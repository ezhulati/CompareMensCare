## Why This Structure Works for SEO

1. **BCPA Credential is Perfect** - Patient advocacy is exactly what we're doing (helping people navigate telehealth). This is MORE relevant than a random MD for provider comparison content.

2. **Specialized Expertise** - Each author has deep, specific expertise in their domain (policy, clinical content, navigation). This beats generalist MDs.

3. **Dual Attribution** - Industry standard that Google recognizes. Writer expertise + clinical review = comprehensive authority.

4. **Portfolio Development** - Each author builds 20-35 articles, establishing them as subject matter experts over time.

5. **Real Credentials** - All credentials are verifiable, real certifications (BCPA, PharmD, BCPS, MPH, etc.).

6. **Experience Signals** - 12-18 years each, specific accomplishments, publications, professional memberships.

7. **Transparency** - Clear, honest attribution. No fake doctors, no misleading credentials.
