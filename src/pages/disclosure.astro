      <h2>How We Earn Money</h2>
      <p>
        When you click on an affiliate link on our site and make a purchase or sign up for
        a service, we may earn a commission. This commission comes at <strong>no extra cost to you</strong>.
        The price you pay is exactly the same whether you use our link or go directly to the
        provider's website.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Editorial Independence</h2>
      <p>
        We want to be absolutely clear: <strong>our affiliate relationships do not influence our
        editorial content, reviews, or ratings</strong>. Here's how we maintain independence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective criteria</strong>: We rate providers based on pricing, service quality, medication options, customer reviews, and other objective factors.</li>
        <li><strong>No preferential treatment</strong>: Providers do not pay for better ratings or rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest reviews</strong>: We highlight both pros and cons for every provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Research-based</strong>: Our comparisons are based on actual pricing research and published customer experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular updates</strong>: We update our content regularly to reflect current prices and services.</li>
      </ul>
