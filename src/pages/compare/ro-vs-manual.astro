        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Price Comparison</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Manual</strong> has the lower starting price at £2.25/dose (approximately $3 USD) for ED medication, making them highly competitive in the UK market. Their transparent, per-dose pricing is straightforward and affordable.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <strong>Ro</strong> starts at $49/month for generic ED medication subscriptions in the US market. While higher than Manual's per-dose pricing, Ro's pricing reflects their more comprehensive platform with ongoing physician access and extensive treatment customization. Currency differences aside, both are competitive leaders in their respective markets.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Treatment Range & Services</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Ro</strong> offers the most comprehensive men's health platform in the US with six major categories: erectile dysfunction, hair loss, testosterone therapy, weight loss (GLP-1s), mental health care, and skincare. This makes Ro a true one-stop-shop for US-based men seeking multiple health services from a single provider.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <strong>Manual</strong> focuses on four core men's health categories: erectile dysfunction, hair loss, testosterone therapy, and weight management. They don't offer mental health or skincare services. Manual's more focused approach means they specialize in essential treatments with proven clinical efficacy.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">

        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Physician Access & Support</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Ro</strong> emphasizes ongoing physician relationships. After your initial consultation, you maintain access to your physician for questions, dose adjustments, treatment changes, and ongoing support. This makes Ro feel more like having a personal doctor rather than just a medication subscription service.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <strong>Manual</strong> provides consultations as needed. You'll have an initial consultation with a GMC-registered doctor, and you can reach out for additional consultations when needed. The model is more focused on efficient medication delivery with medical oversight rather than ongoing physician relationships.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Treatment Customization</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Ro</strong> excels at treatment customization with extensive medication options, flexible dosing, combination therapies, and willingness to accommodate custom treatment requests. If you need a specific dose or want to try different treatment approaches, Ro's physicians have more flexibility to create personalized protocols.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <strong>Manual</strong> offers standard evidence-based treatment protocols that cover most patients' needs. Their approach focuses on proven, straightforward treatments rather than highly customized regimens. This streamlined approach keeps costs down while maintaining clinical efficacy.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Customer Satisfaction</h3>
