## What Are Compounded Medications?

**Compounded medications** are custom-made drugs prepared by licensed pharmacies for individual patients. Unlike mass-produced FDA-approved medications, compounded drugs are made to order.

**Examples in men's health:**
- Compounded semaglutide (instead of Wegovy/Ozempic)
- Compounded tirzepatide (instead of Mounjaro/Zepbound)
- Compounded testosterone creams
- Custom ED medication formulations

## FDA-Approved vs Compounded: Key Differences

### FDA-Approved Medications

**Examples:** Wegovy, Ozempic, Viagra, Cialis (brand names)

**Characteristics:**
- Mass-produced by pharmaceutical manufacturers
- Extensive clinical trials required
- FDA reviews safety and effectiveness data
- Standardized formulation and dosage
- Consistent quality across all pills/vials
- Expensive due to R&D and patent protection

**Regulation:**
- Rigorous FDA approval process
- Ongoing quality monitoring
- Post-market surveillance
- Strict manufacturing standards (cGMP)

### Compounded Medications

**Examples:** Compounded semaglutide from Hims/Ro

**Characteristics:**
- Made by licensed compounding pharmacies
- Same active ingredient as brand-name
- Custom formulated per prescription
- Significantly cheaper (no R&D costs, no patent)
- Quality varies by pharmacy

**Regulation:**
- State pharmacy boards oversee
- Less stringent than FDA drug approval
- No clinical trials required (if using FDA-approved ingredients)
- Must follow USP standards
- Pharmacy licensed and inspected

## Why Do Telehealth Services Offer Compounded Versions?

### Cost Savings

**Brand-name GLP-1s:**
- Wegovy: $1,300-1,500/month
- Zepbound: $1,000-1,200/month

**Compounded versions:**
- $200-600/month

**Savings of $700-1,000/month makes treatment accessible.**

### Drug Shortages

**When brand-name drugs are in shortage**, FDA allows compounding pharmacies to make versions to meet demand.

**Recent shortages:**
- Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic): 2022-2024
- Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound): 2023-2024

**Compounded versions fill the gap.**

### Customization

**Compounding allows:**
- Custom dosing strengths
- Alternative delivery methods
- Removal of allergens or inactive ingredients
- Combination formulations

## Are Compounded Medications Safe?

### When Done Properly: Yes

**Reputable compounding pharmacies:**
- Licensed by state boards
- Follow USP <797> and <795> standards
- Use FDA-approved active ingredients
- Maintain sterile facilities
- Test for quality and potency

**Many compounded medications are safe and effective when:**
- Made by licensed, accredited pharmacies
- Using quality ingredients
- Properly stored and handled
- Prescribed by licensed providers

### Risks and Concerns

**Potential issues:**
- Quality varies between pharmacies
- No FDA pre-market review
- Less oversight than mass-produced drugs
- Potency may vary slightly batch-to-batch
- Contamination risk if not properly made

**FDA warnings:**
- Some compounding pharmacies have quality issues
- Consumers should use only reputable pharmacies
- Verify pharmacy credentials

## How to Ensure Quality with Compounded Medications

### Use Reputable Telehealth Services

**Established companies (Hims, Ro, Numan) partner with:**
- Licensed 503A compounding pharmacies
- FDA-registered facilities
- Pharmacies with quality track records

**These services vet their pharmacy partners.**

### Verify Pharmacy Credentials

**Check that pharmacy is:**
- Licensed in your state
- Accredited by PCAB or ACHC (optional but good sign)
- No FDA warning letters or violations
- Follows USP standards

### Ask Questions

**Before using compounded medication:**
- What pharmacy makes this?
- Is the pharmacy licensed and accredited?
- What quality controls are in place?
- How is potency verified?
- What's the expiration date?

## Compounded vs Brand-Name: Effectiveness

### Clinical Evidence

**For compounded semaglutide/tirzepatide:**
- Same active ingredient as brand-name
- Should have similar effectiveness
- No direct head-to-head studies
- Anecdotal reports suggest comparable results

**Most users report:**
- Similar appetite suppression
- Similar weight loss
- Similar side effects
- No noticeable difference

### Factors Affecting Effectiveness

**Quality matters:**
- Properly compounded = likely same effectiveness
- Poor quality compounding = potentially less effective
- Use reputable pharmacy sources

## Should You Use Compounded Medications?

### When Compounded Makes Sense

**Choose compounded if:**
- Brand-name too expensive ($1,000+/month)
- Insurance doesn't cover brand-name
- Using reputable telehealth service
- Comfortable with slight quality variability
- Need custom dosing

**Good for:** GLP-1 weight loss medications where brand-name costs are prohibitive

### When to Use FDA-Approved

**Choose brand-name if:**
- Insurance covers it (low copay)
- Want maximum quality assurance
- Prefer FDA-reviewed medications
- Can afford the cost
- Have concerns about compounding

## The FDA's Stance on Compounding

**FDA allows compounding when:**
- Prescribed by licensed provider
- For specific patient need
- Made by licensed pharmacy
- During drug shortages (expedited allowance)

**FDA prohibits:**
- Large-scale manufacturing (compounding pharmacies can't mass-produce)
- Compounding copies of FDA-approved drugs except during shortages
- Distributing compounded drugs without prescriptions

**Current status (2025):**
- Compounded GLP-1s allowed due to shortages
- Once shortages resolve, FDA may restrict compounding
- Stay informed about regulatory changes

## Cost Comparison

### GLP-1 Example

**Brand Wegovy:**
- $1,300-1,500/month
- FDA-approved, extensively tested
- Consistent quality

**Compounded Semaglutide:**
- $200-400/month through Hims/Ro
- Same active ingredient
- Made by licensed pharmacy
- 70-85% cost savings

**For most people, compounded is the only affordable option.**

## The Bottom Line

**Compounded medications:**
- Use same active ingredients as brand-name
- Made by licensed pharmacies
- Significantly cheaper (often 70-85% savings)
- Quality depends on pharmacy
- Less regulatory oversight than FDA-approved drugs

**When using compounded medications:**
- Choose reputable telehealth services
- Verify pharmacy credentials
- Expect similar effectiveness
- Understand there's slightly more quality variability
- Monitor your response

**For expensive medications like GLP-1s, compounded versions make treatment accessible while maintaining safety through licensed pharmacy partners.**

**Reputable services offering compounded medications:**
- Hims, Ro (GLP-1s, testosterone)
- Use licensed, quality pharmacies
- Provide physician oversight

**Compounded medications are a valuable option for affordable access to treatment.**
