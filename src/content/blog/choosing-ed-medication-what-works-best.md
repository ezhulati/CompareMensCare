summary: "Four FDA-approved PDE5 inhibitors treat ED with 70-85% effectiveness rates: sildenafil (Viagra) at $4-80/dose works in 30-60 minutes for 4-6 hours; tadalafil (Cialis) at $6-100/dose works in 30-45 minutes for up to 36 hours; vardenafil (Levitra) and avanafil (Stendra) offer similar profiles. Choice depends on timing needs, side effects, cost, and whether you want on-demand vs daily dosing."
summaryPoints:
  - "All 4 FDA-approved ED medications (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) have 70-85% success rates with similar effectiveness"
  - "Cost difference is significant: Generic sildenafil $4-10/dose vs brand Viagra $90-100/dose, both identical effectiveness"
  - "Tadalafil (Cialis) lasts 36 hours vs 4-6 hours for others, making it best for spontaneity and weekend use"

keyTakeaways:
  - "All FDA-approved ED medications work through the same mechanism (PDE5 inhibition) with comparable 70-85% effectiveness rates regardless of brand or generic status."
  - "Generic sildenafil costs $4-10/dose through telehealth vs $90-100 for brand Viagra with zero effectiveness difference—same active ingredient, same FDA standards."
  - "Tadalafil's 36-hour duration makes it ideal for weekend spontaneity while sildenafil's 4-6 hour window works best for planned timing, with daily low-dose tadalafil enabling anytime spontaneity."
  - "Side effects (headache 16%, flushing 10%, nasal congestion 10%) occur at similar rates across all PDE5 inhibitors, though some men tolerate one medication better than others."
  - "Try the lowest effective dose first (sildenafil 50mg, tadalafil 10mg) and adjust based on results—higher doses don't necessarily work better and increase side effects."
  - "Never combine ED medications with nitrates or recreational poppers (amyl nitrite) as this causes dangerous blood pressure drops that can be fatal."
faqs:
  - question: "What's the difference between Viagra and generic sildenafil?"
    answer: "No effectiveness difference—both contain identical active ingredient (sildenafil citrate), same FDA manufacturing standards, same 70-85% success rate. Brand Viagra costs $90-100/dose while generic sildenafil costs $4-10/dose through telehealth. Generics became available in 2017 after patent expiration. The only differences are price, pill appearance, and brand name on packaging."
  - question: "Which ED medication lasts the longest?"
    answer: "Tadalafil (Cialis) lasts up to 36 hours, significantly longer than sildenafil (4-6 hours), vardenafil (4-5 hours), or avanafil (6 hours). This makes tadalafil ideal for weekend use—one Friday evening dose covers through Sunday. However, all medications work effectively within their duration windows. Daily low-dose tadalafil (2.5-5mg) provides 24/7 coverage for spontaneous sex anytime."
  - question: "Is brand name Viagra more effective than generic?"
    answer: "No. Multiple studies confirm identical effectiveness between brand Viagra and generic sildenafil (both 70-85% success rates). FDA requires generics to be bioequivalent—same active ingredient, absorption rate, and blood concentration. The 90-95% cost savings with generics comes from no brand marketing costs, not lower quality. All generics pass the same FDA standards as brand name drugs."
  - question: "What's the best ED medication for spontaneous sex?"
    answer: "Daily low-dose tadalafil (2.5-5mg taken daily) is best for complete spontaneity—always ready without timing. For on-demand use, tadalafil 10-20mg offers 36-hour window vs 4-6 hours for sildenafil. Avanafil (Stendra) works fastest (15-30 minutes) if you need quick onset. Consider your relationship pattern: predictable timing = sildenafil works great; spontaneous/variable timing = daily tadalafil ideal."
  - question: "Can you take ED medication daily?"
    answer: "Yes, daily low-dose tadalafil (2.5mg or 5mg) is FDA-approved for daily use and enables spontaneous sex anytime without planning. This differs from on-demand higher doses (sildenafil 50-100mg, tadalafil 10-20mg) taken only before sex. Daily tadalafil costs $60-120/month through telehealth. It's safe long-term—studies show no issues with continuous daily use for years. Don't take on-demand doses daily."
  - question: "Which ED medication has the fewest side effects?"
    answer: "Side effect rates are similar across all PDE5 inhibitors: headache (10-16%), flushing (10-13%), nasal congestion (4-10%), indigestion (3-9%). However, individual tolerance varies—some men tolerate tadalafil better than sildenafil or vice versa. Visual changes (blue tint) occur slightly more with sildenafil; back pain slightly more with tadalafil. Most side effects are mild, temporary, and decrease with regular use. Try different options if one causes bothersome effects."
  - question: "How do I know which ED medication dose to try first?"
    answer: "Start with standard starting doses: sildenafil 50mg, tadalafil 10mg, vardenafil 10mg, or avanafil 100mg. If effective but causes side effects, lower the dose. If ineffective, try higher dose (sildenafil 100mg, tadalafil 20mg) before switching medications. About 70% respond to starting doses; 85%+ respond after dose adjustment. Providers typically start middle dose and adjust based on your response. Don't start with maximum dose—more isn't always better."

## How to Choose Your ED Medication

### By Timing Needs

**Predictable/planned sex:**
→ Sildenafil (cheapest, effective, shorter duration)

**Spontaneous/variable timing:**
→ Daily tadalafil 2.5-5mg (always ready)

**Weekend plans:**
→ On-demand tadalafil 10-20mg (36-hour window)

**Need fast onset:**
→ Avanafil (works in 15-30 min)

### By Budget

**Most affordable:**
1. Generic sildenafil: $4-10/dose through telehealth platforms (Hims, BlueChew, Ro)
2. Generic tadalafil on-demand: $6-15/dose
3. Generic tadalafil daily: $60-120/month ($2-4/day)

**Higher cost:**
- Brand name Viagra/Cialis: $90-110/dose
- Avanafil: $15-25/dose
- Vardenafil: $8-15/dose

**Cost-saving strategies:**
- Use telehealth (Hims, Ro, BlueChew) for lowest generic prices
- Ask about compounded versions (even cheaper)
- Check GoodRx for pharmacy discounts
- Consider daily tadalafil vs multiple on-demand doses
- Start with sildenafil (cheapest effective option)

### By Relationship Pattern

**New relationship, unpredictable:**
→ Daily tadalafil (removes pressure, always ready)

**Established relationship, scheduled:**
→ Sildenafil on-demand (plan ahead, save money)

**Long-distance relationship, weekend visits:**
→ Tadalafil 10-20mg Friday (covers through Sunday)

**Multiple times per week:**
→ Daily tadalafil (better value than multiple on-demand doses)

### By Side Effect Profile

**All medications have similar side effects:**
- Headache: 10-16%
- Flushing: 10-13%
- Nasal congestion: 4-10%
- Indigestion: 3-9%
- Back pain: 2-12% (slightly more with tadalafil)

**If one causes problems:**
- Try different medication (individual tolerance varies)
- Lower the dose
- Take with food (except tadalafil already food-independent)
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid alcohol

### By Other Medications

**Taking alpha-blockers (prostate):**
- Tadalafil 2.5-5mg daily is safest
- Wait 4 hours between alpha-blocker and on-demand ED medication
- Tell your provider

**Taking nitrates (heart):**
- **CANNOT use any ED medication** (dangerous blood pressure drop)
- Includes nitroglycerin, isosorbide
- Also avoid recreational poppers (amyl nitrite)

**Other heart medications:**
- Usually safe, but tell provider about all medications
- May need dose adjustments

## Brand vs Generic: The Truth

### Effectiveness

**No difference:**
- Same active ingredient
- Same absorption rate
- Same blood levels
- Same FDA standards
- 70-85% success rate for both

**FDA requirements for generics:**
- Bioequivalent (80-125% of brand name blood levels)
- Same manufacturing standards (cGMP)
- Same purity standards
- Rigorous testing

### Cost Difference Explained

**Brand name:**
- Marketing costs
- Brand recognition
- Patent protections (expired)
- $90-100/dose

**Generic:**
- No marketing needed
- Multiple manufacturers compete
- FDA-approved since 2017 (sildenafil)
- $4-10/dose

**You're paying for the name, not better quality.**

### When Brand Might Be Preferred

**Rarely necessary, but some choose brand for:**
- Insurance covers brand but not generic (uncommon)
- Personal preference/trust in brand
- Specific inactive ingredients (allergies)

**For 98% of men, generic is identical in every way that matters.**

## On-Demand vs Daily Dosing

### On-Demand Dosing

**How it works:**
- Take 30-60 minutes before sex
- Higher dose (sildenafil 50-100mg, tadalafil 10-20mg)
- Effective for 4-36 hours depending on medication

**Best for:**
- Infrequent sex (1-2x/week or less)
- Predictable timing
- Lower monthly cost
- Don't want daily medication

**Cost example:**
- 4 times/month: $16-40 (generic sildenafil)
- 8 times/month: $32-80

### Daily Low-Dose

**How it works:**
- Take small dose (tadalafil 2.5-5mg) same time daily
- Always ready for spontaneous sex
- No timing needed
- Steady medication level

**Best for:**
- Frequent sex (3+/week)
- Unpredictable timing
- Want spontaneity
- Don't like planning/timing

**Cost:**
- $60-120/month through telehealth
- $2-4/day

**Considerations:**
- Only tadalafil approved for daily use
- Takes 4-5 days to reach steady levels
- Must take every day (not as-needed)

### Which Saves Money?

**On-demand is cheaper if:**
- Sex 1-2 times/week or less
- Predictable schedule
- Don't mind timing

**Daily is cheaper if:**
- Sex 3+ times/week
- Multiple rounds in 36 hours
- Want readiness for spontaneous opportunities

**Example:**
- On-demand: 12 times/month = $48-120
- Daily: Same month = $60-120
- Daily wins at 3+/week frequency
