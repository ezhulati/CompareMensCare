## 10 Ways to Save on Telehealth Prescriptions

### 1. Always Choose Generic Medications

**Savings: 85-95%**

**Brand-name vs generic costs:**
- Viagra: $70/pill → Sildenafil: $2-8/pill
- Cialis: $70/pill → Tadalafil: $3-10/pill
- Propecia: $80/month → Finasteride: $10-30/month

**Generic medications are FDA-approved, equally effective, and dramatically cheaper.**

**Action:** Always request generic when available.

### 2. Buy in Bulk (3-6 Month Supply)

**Savings: 10-30%**

**Most telehealth services offer discounts for:**
- 3-month supply: 10-15% off
- 6-month supply: 20-30% off

**Example:**
- Monthly: $50/month = $600/year
- 6-month supply: $40/month = $480/year
- **Savings: $120/year**

**Action:** Order larger quantities if you know you'll use them.

### 3. Compare Telehealth Platforms

**Savings: $20-100/month**

**Price comparison for ED treatment:**
- Hims: $2-8 per dose (cheapest)
- Ro: $2-10 per dose
- BlueChew: $3-9 per dose
- Traditional pharmacy: $15-30 per generic dose

**Action:** Shop around before committing. Different services have different pricing.

### 4. Use HSA or FSA Funds

**Savings: 20-30% through tax benefits**

**Health Savings Accounts (HSA) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) can pay for:**
- Prescription medications
- Telehealth consultations
- Lab testing
- Medical weight loss programs

**How it saves money:**
- Pre-tax dollars = effective 20-30% discount
- Example: $100/month medication costs only $70-80 after tax savings

**Action:** Use your HSA/FSA debit card for telehealth purchases.

### 5. Look for First-Time Customer Discounts

**Savings: $20-100 first order**

**Most services offer:**
- 20-50% off first order
- Free shipping on first order
- Trial periods at reduced rates

**Action:** Check for promo codes before ordering. Search "[Service Name] promo code" or check their homepage.

### 6. Subscribe for Auto-Refills (Then Monitor)

**Savings: 10-20%**

**Subscription benefits:**
- Automatic discounts
- Free shipping
- Priority customer service
- No order minimums

**Important:** Can cancel anytime, so subscribe for discount then manage as needed.

**Action:** Sign up for subscription, set calendar reminder to evaluate if still needed.

### 7. Use Compounded Medications When Appropriate

**Savings: 70-85% for some medications**

**Biggest savings for:**
- GLP-1 weight loss drugs:
  - Brand Wegovy: $1,300/month
  - Compounded semaglutide: $200-400/month
  - **Savings: $900-1,100/month**

**Action:** Ask if compounded version available for expensive medications.

### 8. Skip Unnecessary Add-Ons

**Savings: $20-100/month**

**Avoid:**
- Premium shipping if not urgent ($10-30)
- Optional supplements ($30-60/month)
- Unnecessary consultation upgrades ($50-100)
- Expedited processing fees ($20-40)

**Action:** Stick to what you actually need. Standard shipping is usually fast enough (2-5 days).

### 9. Combine Treatments with One Provider

**Savings: $30-80/month**

**Bundle discounts:**
- Some services offer discounts for multiple treatments
- Save on shipping with combined orders
- Single consultation fee covers multiple prescriptions

**Example:**
- ED + Hair Loss through one provider: $70/month combined
- Separate providers: $50 + $40 = $90/month
- **Savings: $20/month**

**Action:** If you need multiple treatments, use one platform for all.

### 10. Time Your Orders Strategically

**Savings: Variable**

**Strategic timing:**
- Black Friday / holiday sales (20-30% off)
- New Year promotions (January)
- End of quarter sales
- New customer promotions

**Action:** Stock up during promotional periods if you're a long-term user.
