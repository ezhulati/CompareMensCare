summary: "GLP-1 side effects follow a brutal-then-better pattern: Weeks 1-4 are easy (30% mild nausea), weeks 5-8 are the worst (50-60% moderate nausea, the hardest period), then symptoms improve 70-80% by months 3-4 as your body adapts. The first dose increase (0.25mg to 0.5mg) hits hardest—this is when most people quit. But 80-85% who push through feel mostly normal by month 4-6 while still losing weight. About 10-15% have persistent side effects requiring dose adjustment or discontinuation."
summaryPoints:
  - "Weeks 1-4 are surprisingly easy (only 30-40% get mild nausea)—this 'honeymoon period' doesn't predict what's coming at the first dose increase"
  - "Weeks 5-8 (first increase to 0.5mg) are the absolute worst—50-60% experience moderate-severe nausea peaking 2-4 days after injection, many think 'I can't do this'"
  - "Each subsequent dose increase triggers a mini-wave of side effects lasting 1-2 weeks, but they're progressively easier than the first increase as your body adapts"
  - "By months 4-6, 80-85% of people feel mostly normal with minimal nausea but strong appetite suppression—the side effects fade but the weight loss continues"

faqTitle: "GLP-1 Side Effects Timeline"
keyTakeaways:
  - "The first dose increase (0.25mg to 0.5mg semaglutide, weeks 5-6) is the hardest period for most people—if you make it through this, subsequent increases are usually manageable."
  - "Nausea peaks 24-72 hours after each injection and fades over the following 4-5 days, creating a weekly cycle you can plan around during the rough early months."
  - "Side effects don't predict weight loss—people with severe nausea don't necessarily lose more weight than those sailing through with minimal symptoms."
  - "80% of people who discontinue do so in the first 3 months (mostly during weeks 5-8)—but symptoms improve dramatically for those who persist past this phase."
  - "Serious side effects (pancreatitis, gastroparesis) typically emerge after months of use, not immediately—requires ongoing monitoring even after the rough early period passes."
  - "Slower titration (6-8 weeks at each dose instead of standard 4 weeks) can reduce side effect severity by 50-70% for people struggling with nausea."
faqs:
  - question: "When do GLP-1 side effects start?"
    answer: "Within 24-72 hours of your first injection, but the severity escalates dramatically at dose increases—especially the first one. First injection (0.25mg semaglutide): 60-70% feel totally normal or just slightly less hungry. 30-40% get mild reduced appetite or queasiness. Most people think 'this isn't bad at all.' First dose increase to 0.5mg (weeks 5-6): This is when reality hits. 50-60% experience moderate-severe nausea (worst 2-4 days after injection). 40-50% have dramatic appetite suppression ('I have to force myself to eat'). 20-30% get diarrhea or constipation. 15-25% experience vomiting. This week catches people off guard because the first month was easy. Subsequent increases: Each triggers a 1-2 week wave of side effects, but typically milder than the first increase. Pattern: Symptoms peak 2-5 days post-injection when medication levels are highest, then fade over next 3-5 days before next weekly injection. During titration, you're on a weekly rollercoaster."

  - question: "How long does GLP-1 nausea last?"
    answer: "The brutal phase is weeks 5-12 (first two dose increases), then it improves dramatically. Here's the real timeline: Weeks 5-6 (0.5mg): Worst nausea. 50-60% have moderate-severe symptoms. Days 2-4 after injection are peak misery. Week 7-8: Improving—nausea down 40-50% from peak as body adapts to 0.5mg. Weeks 9-10 (1mg increase): Nausea returns but usually less intense than first increase. 30-40% have moderate symptoms. Weeks 11-12: Improving again. Months 3-4 at stable dose: 70-80% improvement from peak. Only 15-25% still have moderate nausea. Most people feel 'pretty normal.' Months 6+: Minimal nausea for 80-85% of users. 10-15% have persistent mild nausea. Key insight: If you're at week 6 thinking 'I can't do this for a year,' you're judging based on the worst week. By month 4, most people forget they're on medication except when they're not hungry. The 10-15% who have persistent nausea past month 6 usually need dose reduction or to switch medications—this isn't 'push through it' territory."

  - question: "What are the worst weeks for GLP-1 side effects?"
    answer: "Weeks 5-6 (first increase to 0.5mg semaglutide) are the absolute worst for most people. If someone quits, it's usually here. The hardest periods ranked: #1: Weeks 5-6 (0.5mg first increase) - 50-60% have significant nausea, many experience vomiting, this is when most discontinuations happen, the jump from 0.25mg to 0.5mg is brutal because it's your first encounter with therapeutic GLP-1 levels. #2: Weeks 9-10 (1mg second increase) - 30-40% moderate symptoms, usually less severe than first increase, your body has some adaptation now. #3: Weeks 17-18 (2.4mg final increase for Wegovy) - 20-30% increased nausea, many people tolerate this better than earlier increases, but 10-15% find 2.4mg too much and drop to 2mg or 1.7mg. Easier periods: Weeks 1-4 (0.25mg): 'Honeymoon'—most people think 'this is easy!' Weeks 13-16 (1.7mg): Many hardly notice this increase. Months 5+: Side effects largely resolved. Why the first increase is uniquely terrible: Largest relative dose jump (100% increase). First time your stomach actually slows dramatically. Psychological shock ('wait, this is what the medication really feels like'). You haven't developed coping strategies yet. If you make it through weeks 5-8, you've survived the worst."

  - question: "Do GLP-1 side effects get better over time?"
    answer: "Yes, dramatically—but you have to survive the first 8-12 weeks. Timeline of improvement: Weeks 1-4 at new dose: Peak side effects, worst symptoms, hardest days. Weeks 5-8 at stable dose: 50-60% improvement in nausea/GI symptoms as body adapts. Weeks 9-12+ at stable dose: 70-80% improvement. Most people feel 'normal' with minimal symptoms but still have strong appetite suppression (which is the point). Why it improves: Your GI tract adapts to slower motility. Brain adjusts to GLP-1 receptor stimulation. You learn trigger foods and coping strategies. What improves: Nausea: Dramatically better by weeks 8-12 for 80% of people. Vomiting: Usually resolves by weeks 6-10. Diarrhea: Often improves by weeks 4-8. What stays: Appetite suppression: Remains strong (desired effect). Delayed gastric emptying: Persists while on medication. Food aversions: Can be long-lasting for some. Constipation: May be ongoing issue requiring management. Who doesn't improve: 10-15% continue having moderate symptoms even after 6+ months. These people need to either reduce dose, switch medications (try tirzepatide if on semaglutide), or discontinue. Don't suffer for months assuming it'll get better—if you're at month 6 with persistent severe nausea, that's your answer."

  - question: "What are the long-term side effects of GLP-1 medications?"
    answer: "While nausea improves, some effects emerge or persist with extended use (6+ months to years): Gallstones/gallbladder disease (3-8% over 1-2 years): Risk increases with any rapid weight loss method. Sharp right upper abdominal pain, especially after fatty meals. 1-2% require gallbladder removal. Higher risk with faster weight loss (losing >2-3 lbs/week). Gastroparesis (rare but serious, <1%): Severe persistent nausea/vomiting that doesn't improve. Food sitting in stomach for many hours. Can take months to resolve after stopping medication. May require hospitalization. This is different from the common 'delayed gastric emptying' that improves. Chronic constipation (10-20% long-term): Slowed GI motility continues. Requires ongoing fiber, fluids, possibly laxatives. Muscle loss (preventable): Can lose 25-40% of weight from muscle if not doing resistance training. Leads to lower metabolism, fatigue, weakness. Nutritional deficiencies (if not monitored): Protein deficiency from suppressed appetite (hair loss, weakness). Vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron deficiency. Requires supplementation and tracking. Skin changes: Loose skin from weight loss. 'Ozempic face' (facial fat loss—more noticeable in older adults). Monitoring for long-term use: Labs every 6-12 months (metabolic panel, vitamin levels). Ultrasound if gallbladder pain develops. Regular check-ins about GI function and nutrition. Body composition tracking (not just weight). Important: Most people on GLP-1s long-term feel fine—these are risks to monitor, not guaranteed outcomes."

  - question: "How can you minimize GLP-1 side effects?"
    answer: "Strategic management can reduce side effects by 50-70%: (1) Titrate slower: Spend 6-8 weeks at each dose instead of standard 4 weeks. Gives body more time to adapt. Some providers will prescribe custom slower schedules. (2) Get anti-nausea meds before starting: Ondansetron (Zofran) 4-8mg as needed is highly effective. Don't wait until you're miserable. Take it preventively days 2-4 after injection if needed. (3) Eat smaller, frequent meals: Large meals trigger worse nausea. 4-6 small meals instead of 3 large. Stop eating before feeling full. (4) Choose low-fat, bland foods during rough weeks: High-fat meals dramatically worsen nausea. Avoid fried foods, cream sauces, fatty meats. Focus on lean proteins, vegetables, whole grains, toast, rice. (5) Time injections strategically: Many inject at night so nausea occurs during sleep. Or inject Friday evening so worst days are weekend. (6) Use ginger: Ginger tea, ginger chews, ginger capsules (1-2g daily). Evidence-based anti-nausea remedy. (7) Stay hydrated: Dehydration worsens everything. 64-80oz water daily, sip throughout day. (8) Manage constipation proactively: Increase fiber gradually, daily magnesium (400mg), MiraLAX if needed. Don't wait for severe constipation. (9) Avoid triggers: Alcohol (worsens nausea), high-sugar foods, caffeine on empty stomach, spicy foods, cooking smells that trigger nausea. (10) Consider switching medications: If semaglutide causes severe nausea, try tirzepatide—different side effect profile for some people (more diarrhea, less nausea). When to reduce dose: Vomiting >once per week. Unable to stay hydrated. Severe daily nausea interfering with work/life. Better to reduce dose and stay on medication long-term than push through and quit entirely."

  - question: "When should you stop taking GLP-1 medications due to side effects?"
    answer: "Most side effects are manageable, but certain symptoms require stopping or dose reduction: Stop immediately and seek medical attention: Severe persistent abdominal pain (especially upper abdomen radiating to back)—possible pancreatitis. Persistent vomiting for 24+ hours (unable to keep down food/fluids)—dehydration risk, possible gastroparesis. Vision changes, severe eye pain—rare retinopathy. Signs of allergic reaction (rash, facial swelling, difficulty breathing). Severe hypoglycemia if using with diabetes medications. Consider dose reduction or stopping: Nausea/vomiting interfering with daily life after 8+ weeks at stable dose despite management strategies. Severe fatigue preventing normal activities. Unintentional malnutrition (can't eat enough protein—hair loss, weakness). Worsening depression or anxiety. Quality of life worse on medication than off. Weight loss too rapid (>3 lbs/week sustained—risks muscle loss and gallstones). Discontinuation stats: 5-10% discontinue due to intolerable side effects. 80-90% of discontinuations happen in first 3 months (mostly weeks 5-8). Most common reasons: severe persistent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Important perspective: Side effects should improve by week 8-12 at stable dose. If they're not improving or getting worse, that's your body telling you something. Reducing dose is often better than stopping—many people tolerate 1mg well even if 2.4mg caused severe symptoms. You can lose weight effectively at lower doses. Don't suffer in silence or 'tough it out' past month 4-6 if symptoms aren't improving—work with provider to find tolerable approach or consider stopping."

You're reading about GLP-1 side effects at 2 AM because you're terrified. Your doctor prescribed Wegovy, you filled the prescription, but now you're Googling horror stories. "Vomiting for months." "Worst nausea of my life." "Had to quit after two weeks."

You're wondering: **Am I going to be sick for a year? Will I throw up at work? Can I even do this?**

The clinical data shows: **Weeks 5-8 are difficult for most people (50-60% get moderate-severe nausea), then it gets dramatically better. By month 4, most people adjust—appetite remains suppressed while side effects diminish significantly.**

This guide tells you exactly what to expect month by month, which weeks are worst, when it gets better, and what you can actually control.

## The Part Nobody Tells You Upfront

**The first month is surprisingly easy. Then the first dose increase kicks your ass. Then it gets better.**

What happens:

- **Weeks 1-4 (0.25mg starting dose)**: 60-70% of people feel totally normal or slightly less hungry. You think "this isn't bad at all!" This is the trap.
- **Weeks 5-8 (first increase to 0.5mg)**: Reality hits. 50-60% get moderate-severe nausea. Peak misery is days 2-4 after injection. You think "I can't do this." Most people who quit, quit here.
- **Weeks 9-12 (second increase to 1mg)**: Another wave of nausea, but usually less intense than the first increase. You have some adaptation now.
- **Months 4-6**: Symptoms improve 70-80% from peak. Most people feel mostly normal with strong appetite suppression but minimal nausea.
- **Months 6+**: 80-85% of people have minimal side effects. 10-15% still struggle and may need dose adjustment.

**If you're at week 6 thinking "I'm going to feel like this forever," you're not.** You're judging based on the worst week.

## Month-by-Month Reality Check

### Months 1 (Weeks 1-4): The Honeymoon

**Dose**: 0.25mg semaglutide (or 2.5mg tirzepatide)

**What actually happens**:
- 60-70% of people: "I feel totally fine. Maybe slightly less hungry?"
- 30-40% of people: Mild reduced appetite, slight queasiness 1-2 days after injection, minor fatigue

**What you're thinking**: "All those horror stories were exaggerated. This is easy!"

**Reality check**: This is a sub-therapeutic "tolerance-building" dose. It's not supposed to hit hard yet. The medication is introducing your body to GLP-1 gradually.

**What to do**:
- Enjoy the easy phase
- Start eating smaller portions even though you could eat more (practice for what's coming)
- Get an ondansetron (Zofran) prescription now—have it ready before week 5
- Start resistance training if you haven't (prevents muscle loss later)

### Month 2 (Weeks 5-8): Welcome to Hell

**Dose**: First increase to 0.5mg (or 5mg tirzepatide)

**What actually happens**:
- 50-60% of people: Moderate to severe nausea, especially days 2-4 after injection
- 40-50%: "I have to force myself to eat anything"
- 20-30%: Diarrhea or constipation
- 15-25%: Occasional vomiting
- 30-40%: Significant fatigue

**Peak suffering**: Days 2-4 after injection (when medication levels peak in your system)

**What you're thinking**:
- "I feel like I have morning sickness"
- "Everything sounds disgusting"
- "I can't smell cooking meat without gagging"
- "I made a huge mistake"

**Why this is the hardest period**: The jump from 0.25mg to 0.5mg is the largest relative increase (100%). Your body is encountering therapeutic GLP-1 levels for the first time. Your stomach is dramatically slowing down. This is the dose where the medication actually starts working—and your body is not happy about it.

**By week 7-8**: Symptoms start improving—nausea down 40-50% from peak as your body adapts.

**What actually helps** (not the bullshit generic advice):
- **Take Zofran**: Ondansetron 4-8mg as needed. Don't "tough it out." Take it days 2-4 after injection if needed.
- **Eat bland low-fat foods**: Chicken breast, rice, toast, plain pasta. High-fat meals make nausea 10x worse.
- **Inject at night**: Many people inject evening/night so the worst nausea happens while sleeping.
- **Plan around it**: Don't schedule important work meetings or social events for days 2-4 after injection.
- **Ginger everything**: Ginger tea, ginger chews, ginger capsules. Actually helps.
- **Small frequent meals**: 5-6 tiny meals instead of 3 normal ones.
- **Stop eating before you're full**: Overeating triggers immediate nausea.

**Most important**: This phase passes. Weeks 5-6 are peak misery. By week 8, you'll feel noticeably better.

### Month 3 (Weeks 9-12): Second Wave (But Easier)

**Dose**: Second increase to 1mg (or 7.5mg tirzepatide)

**What actually happens**:
- 30-40%: Moderate nausea (usually less severe than first increase)
- 20-30%: Fatigue
- 15-25%: GI upset

**What you're thinking**: "Here we go again... but not as bad as 0.5mg"

**Why it's easier**: Your body has adapted to GLP-1 effects. The dose is doubling again, but the relative adjustment feels smaller because you're not starting from zero adaptation.

**Peak symptoms**: Days 2-4 after injection, but typically milder than the first increase.

**By weeks 11-12**: Most people feel significantly better—60-70% have minimal to mild nausea.

**What to do**: Same strategies as weeks 5-8. Keep Zofran handy. Bland foods during the adjustment week.

### Month 4 (Weeks 13-16): Getting Tolerable

**Dose**: Third increase to 1.7mg Wegovy (or 10mg tirzepatide)

**What actually happens**:
- 50-60%: Minimal symptoms, hardly notice the increase
- 20-30%: Mild nausea for 3-5 days post-injection
- 10-15%: Occasional vomiting or significant nausea

**What you're thinking**: "I can actually live like this"

**Why it's easier**: Smaller dose increase (1mg → 1.7mg = 70% increase vs 100% earlier) + your body is well-adapted to the medication now.

**By week 16**: Most people feel close to normal with strong appetite suppression but minimal nausea.

### Month 5 (Weeks 17-20): Final Hurdle

**Dose**: Maximum dose 2.4mg (or 15mg tirzepatide)

**What actually happens**:
- 70-80%: Tolerate well with minimal symptoms
- 20-30%: Moderate nausea first week
- 10-15%: "This dose is too much"—significant side effects requiring dose reduction

**Who struggles at maximum dose**:
- Smaller individuals
- People who had persistent side effects at lower doses
- People who titrated too fast (didn't spend enough time at each level)

**What to do if 2.4mg is intolerable**: Drop back to 2mg or 1.7mg. Many people do fine at 2mg with better tolerance. You can still lose weight effectively at lower doses.

**By weeks 22-24**: Most people feel well-adjusted—minimal GI symptoms, strong appetite suppression, weight steadily dropping.

### Months 6-12+: The Maintenance Reality

**What actually happens**:
- 80-85%: Minimal GI side effects, feel mostly normal
- 10-15%: Occasional mild nausea (especially if eating fatty foods or overeating)
- 5-10%: Persistent moderate symptoms (these people usually need dose adjustment)

**What you're thinking**: "I forget I'm on medication except that I'm never hungry and I've lost 35 pounds"

**The new focus**: Side effects are no longer the main story. Now you're managing:
- Nutrition (getting enough protein despite low appetite)
- Muscle preservation (resistance training)
- Long-term monitoring (gallstones, nutritional deficiencies)

**Long-term effects to watch for** (not the early nausea):
- Gallstones (3-8% over 1-2 years, especially with rapid weight loss)
- Chronic constipation (10-20%, requires ongoing management)
- Nutritional deficiencies (low protein, vitamins—need supplementation)
- Muscle loss (preventable with resistance training)

## The Weekly Cycle (During Titration)

During the rough months (2-4), you'll notice a pattern:

**Day 1 (Injection day)**: Feel fine, maybe slight appetite suppression

**Days 2-4**: Peak side effects—nausea worst, appetite suppression strongest, fatigue highest

**Days 5-6**: Symptoms fading

**Day 7**: Feeling much better, almost normal

**Then you inject again.** It's a weekly rollercoaster during dose escalation.

**What this means**: You can plan your life around this. Inject Friday night → worst days are Saturday-Monday → feel better by Wednesday. Or inject Sunday night → worst days are Tuesday-Thursday → weekend plans safe.

## What You Can Actually Control

You can't control whether you're in the "smooth sailing 30%" or the "rough start 50%." But you can control your response:

### Things That Actually Help:
1. **Slower titration**: Ask provider for 6-8 weeks at each dose instead of 4 weeks. Reduces side effect severity by 50-70% for many people.
2. **Anti-nausea meds**: Ondansetron (Zofran) is highly effective. Don't suffer unnecessarily.
3. **Injection timing**: Night injection = sleep through worst hours.
4. **Food choices**: Low-fat, bland, small portions. High-fat meals trigger immediate misery.
5. **Hydration**: 64-80oz water daily. Dehydration makes everything worse.
6. **Managing constipation early**: Daily magnesium (400mg), fiber, MiraLAX if needed. Don't let it get severe.

### Things That Don't Help (Despite What You'll Read):
- "Just push through it" (suffering for 6 months isn't noble—adjust dose)
- "Eat ginger and you'll be fine" (helps a little, not a miracle)
- "The nausea means it's working" (no—side effects don't predict weight loss)
- "Everyone adjusts eventually" (10-15% don't—and that's okay)

## Red Flags: When to Actually Stop

Most side effects are uncomfortable but not dangerous. But certain symptoms mean **stop and call your doctor**:

**Stop immediately**:
- Severe persistent abdominal pain, especially upper abdomen radiating to back (possible pancreatitis)
- Vomiting for 24+ hours, can't keep down fluids (dehydration risk, possible gastroparesis)
- Vision changes or severe eye pain
- Signs of allergic reaction (rash, facial swelling, difficulty breathing)

**Call provider soon**:
- Vomiting more than once per week regularly
- Severe nausea not improving after 8 weeks at stable dose
- Can't eat adequate protein (hair loss, weakness, muscle wasting)
- Sharp right upper abdominal pain after eating (possible gallstones)
- Worsening depression or anxiety
- Quality of life is worse on medication than off

## The Discontinuation Reality

**5-10% of people quit due to intolerable side effects.** 80-90% of those quit in the first 3 months, mostly during weeks 5-8.

**If you're going to quit, it'll probably be during the first dose increase.** And that's a valid choice—medication isn't for everyone.

**But**: If you make it to month 4, you'll probably make it to month 12 and beyond. The people who discontinue after 6+ months usually do so for reasons other than nausea (cost, weight loss plateaus, life changes).

## Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide Side Effect Differences

Some people tolerate one better than the other:

**Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound)**:
- More diarrhea, less nausea (for some people)
- Slightly better tolerated at equivalent doses (for some people)
- Same general timeline pattern

**Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic)**:
- More nausea, more constipation (for some people)
- More aversions to specific foods/smells

**If you're struggling badly with one, switching to the other is worth trying.** Maybe 30-40% of people who can't tolerate semaglutide do fine on tirzepatide, and vice versa.

## Your Week 6 Pep Talk (You'll Need This)

You're at week 6. You've been nauseous for 10 days straight. You threw up yesterday. You're exhausted. You're Googling "how to stop Wegovy" and reading this.

**What you need to know**:

You're in the worst week. This is the week that determines whether you make it or quit. Most people who discontinue do it right now.

**You have three options**:

**Option 1**: Push through for 2 more weeks. By week 8, symptoms will be 40-50% better. By week 12, 70% better. This is the "tough it out" approach. It works for many people.

**Option 2**: Drop back to 0.25mg for 2-4 more weeks, then try 0.5mg again. Slower titration. Reduces peak side effects. Takes longer to reach maintenance dose but better tolerated.

**Option 3**: Stop. It's okay. This medication isn't for everyone. Forcing yourself to be miserable for months isn't sustainable.

**What I'd do**: If I'm vomiting multiple times per week or can't function at work—drop back to 0.25mg or stop. If I'm just nauseated and tired but functional—push through 2 more weeks with Zofran and see if it improves by week 8.

**Most important**: You're not weak for struggling. This week sucks for most people. And it does get better—but you have to decide if "better by week 12" is worth "miserable for the next 4 weeks."

## The Month 4 Check-In (Are You In the 10-15%?)

You're at month 4. You've reached 1.7mg or higher. But you still have moderate-severe nausea most days. It's not improving like everyone said it would.

**This is your signal**: You're probably in the 10-15% who don't adapt well to GLP-1s.

**What to do**:
1. **Try reducing dose**: Many people tolerate 1mg beautifully even though 1.7-2.4mg caused persistent nausea. You can lose weight effectively at lower doses.
2. **Switch medications**: If on semaglutide, try tirzepatide. Different side effect profiles.
3. **Discuss stopping**: If quality of life is worse on medication than off, that's your answer. Weight loss isn't worth months of misery.

**Don't assume "I just need to push through longer."** If you're at month 6 with persistent severe symptoms, that's your body telling you this medication isn't right for you.

## Summary

**GLP-1 side effects follow a brutal-then-better pattern for 80-85% of people:**

Weeks 1-4: Easy (the trap)
Weeks 5-8: Hell (the test)
Weeks 9-12: Better (the relief)
Months 4-6: Mostly normal (the payoff)
Months 6+: Minimal symptoms (the maintenance)

**If you're about to start**: Prepare for weeks 5-8 to be rough. Have Zofran ready. Plan light schedule days 2-4 after injections. Slower titration if you're sensitive.

**If you're in week 6 thinking "I can't do this"**: You're in the worst week. It gets 70% better by week 12 for most people. But dropping back to lower dose or stopping are both valid options.

**If you're at month 6 still struggling**: You're probably in the 10-15% who need dose adjustment or discontinuation. Don't suffer indefinitely.

**The goal**: Effective weight loss with tolerable side effects. For most people, that's achievable by month 4-6. If it's not, adjust the plan.
