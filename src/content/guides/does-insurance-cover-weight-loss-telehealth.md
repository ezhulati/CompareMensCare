## The Short Answer

**Insurance coverage for weight loss varies dramatically:**

- **Telehealth consultations:** Usually covered (83% of insurers cover telehealth)
- **Weight loss medications (GLP-1s):** Often NOT covered unless for diabetes
- **Medicare:** Does NOT cover weight loss medications
- **Medicaid:** Varies by state
- **Private insurance:** Depends on your specific plan

**Bottom line:** Check your specific plan. Most people pay out-of-pocket for weight loss medications.
