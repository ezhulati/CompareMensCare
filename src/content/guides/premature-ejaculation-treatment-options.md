faqTitle: "Premature Ejaculation Treatment FAQs"
faqCategory: "Sexual Health"
faqs:
  - question: "What is the most effective medication for premature ejaculation?"
    answer: "SSRIs, particularly paroxetine and sertraline, are the most effective medications for PE. Studies show paroxetine can increase ejaculatory latency by 6-8 times baseline, while sertraline increases it by 3-5 times. However, these are prescribed off-label as no FDA-approved PE medications exist in the U.S."
  - question: "How long does it take for PE medications to work?"
    answer: "SSRIs require daily use for 2-3 weeks to reach maximum effectiveness. Topical anesthetics work immediately (within 15-30 minutes). PDE5 inhibitors work within 30-60 minutes when used for PE."
  - question: "Can I get PE treatment online?"
    answer: "Yes, platforms like Hims, RexMD, and other telehealth services now offer online consultations and prescriptions for PE treatment. You complete a health questionnaire, a licensed provider reviews it, and if appropriate, prescribes medication delivered to your door."
  - question: "What are the side effects of SSRIs for PE?"
    answer: "Common side effects include decreased libido (20-30% of users), mild nausea, fatigue, and slight erectile difficulties in some men. Most side effects are mild and improve after 2-3 weeks. The benefit often outweighs the risks for men with significant PE."
  - question: "Is dapoxetine available in the United States?"
    answer: "No, dapoxetine is not FDA-approved in the United States, though it's available in many other countries. U.S. providers typically prescribe other SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine) off-label instead."
  - question: "Do behavioral techniques really work for PE?"
    answer: "Yes, behavioral techniques like the stop-start method and squeeze technique can be effective, especially when practiced consistently. They work best when combined with medication and partner involvement. Success rates range from 45-65% when practiced regularly."

# Premature Ejaculation Treatment Options: Complete Guide

Premature ejaculation (PE) is one of the most common sexual dysfunctions, affecting 30-40% of men at some point in their lives. Despite its prevalence, many men don't seek treatment due to embarrassment or lack of awareness about available options. This comprehensive guide covers all evidence-based treatments for PE, from medications to behavioral techniques to online telehealth solutions.

## Understanding Premature Ejaculation

**Definition**: Ejaculation that occurs within 1-2 minutes of penetration (or before desired) with inability to delay and causing personal distress.

**Types**:
- **Lifelong PE**: Present since first sexual experiences
- **Acquired PE**: Develops after period of normal ejaculatory control
- **Variable PE**: Inconsistent, occurs occasionally
- **Subjective PE**: Perceived as premature despite normal ejaculatory latency

## Treatment Categories

### 1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

**Most Effective Medication Option**

SSRIs are antidepressants that delay ejaculation as a side effect. While not FDA-approved specifically for PE, they're the most evidence-backed treatment option.

#### Paroxetine (Paxil)
**Most Effective SSRI for PE**
- **Dosage**: 10-40mg daily
- **Effectiveness**: Increases ejaculatory latency by 6-8 times
- **Time to effect**: 2-3 weeks of daily use
- **Side effects**: Decreased libido (20-30%), mild nausea, fatigue
- **Cost**: $10-30/month (generic)

#### Sertraline (Zoloft)
**Popular Alternative to Paroxetine**
- **Dosage**: 25-200mg daily
- **Effectiveness**: Increases ejaculatory latency by 3-5 times
- **Time to effect**: 2-3 weeks of daily use
- **Side effects**: Similar to paroxetine but slightly milder
- **Cost**: $10-25/month (generic)

#### Fluoxetine (Prozac)
**Less Effective but Well-Tolerated**
- **Dosage**: 20-40mg daily
- **Effectiveness**: Increases ejaculatory latency by 2-4 times
- **Note**: Less effective than paroxetine or sertraline
- **Cost**: $10-20/month (generic)

#### Dapoxetine (Not Available in U.S.)
**On-Demand SSRI Designed for PE**
- **Status**: FDA-approved in 60+ countries but NOT in the United States
- **Dosage**: 30-60mg taken 1-3 hours before sex
- **Effectiveness**: Increases ejaculatory latency by 3-4 times
- **Advantage**: On-demand use (not daily)
- **Why unavailable**: FDA has not approved despite multiple applications

**SSRI Treatment Considerations**:
- Must be taken daily, not on-demand (except dapoxetine abroad)
- Takes 2-3 weeks to reach full effectiveness
- Stopping suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms
- May decrease libido as trade-off for better control
- Work best for lifelong and acquired PE

### 2. Topical Anesthetics

**Immediate Effect, Applied Before Sex**

Topical numbing agents reduce penile sensitivity, delaying ejaculation.

#### Lidocaine/Prilocaine Cream or Spray
- **How to use**: Apply 15-30 minutes before sex
- **Effectiveness**: Increases ejaculatory latency by 2-5 times
- **Duration**: Effects last 30-60 minutes
- **Pros**: Works immediately, on-demand use, no systemic side effects
- **Cons**: May reduce sensation for both partners, requires timing
- **Cost**: $15-40 per bottle/tube

#### Benzocaine Wipes/Sprays
- **Examples**: Promescent spray, Roman Swipes
- **Application**: 5-15 minutes before sex
- **Effectiveness**: Similar to lidocaine
- **Advantage**: Faster absorption than creams
- **Disadvantage**: Can transfer to partner

**Topical Treatment Tips**:
- Wash off excess before intercourse to prevent partner numbness
- Use condoms to prevent transfer
- Start with lower amounts and increase as needed
- Works best for occasional PE, not daily use

### 3. PDE5 Inhibitors (ED Medications)

**Helpful When PE Co-Exists with ED**

#### Sildenafil (Viagra) and Tadalafil (Cialis)
- **Primary use**: Erectile dysfunction
- **PE benefit**: Increases ejaculatory latency by 2-3 times when PE occurs with ED
- **Mechanism**: Improved erections reduce performance anxiety
- **Dosage**: Standard ED doses (sildenafil 25-100mg, tadalafil 5-20mg)
- **Best for**: Men with both PE and ED
- **Cost**: $4-12 per dose (generic)

**Evidence**:
- Studies show PDE5 inhibitors can help PE, especially when combined with psychological factors
- Less effective than SSRIs for PE alone
- Most effective when PE is secondary to ED or performance anxiety

### 4. Combination Therapy

**Often Most Effective Approach**

Combining multiple treatments can enhance results:

#### SSRI + Behavioral Techniques
- **Effectiveness**: Up to 80-90% improvement
- **Benefits**: Addresses both biological and psychological factors
- **Timeline**: 4-8 weeks for full effect

#### PDE5 Inhibitor + SSRI
- **Best for**: Men with both PE and ED
- **Effectiveness**: Better than either alone
- **Monitoring**: Requires medical oversight

#### Topical + Behavioral Techniques
- **Best for**: On-demand treatment without daily medication
- **Effectiveness**: 60-75% improvement
- **Advantage**: No systemic side effects

### 5. Behavioral Techniques

**Free, Effective with Practice**

#### Stop-Start Technique
1. Stimulate penis until close to ejaculation
2. Stop all stimulation and wait for arousal to decrease
3. Resume stimulation after 30-60 seconds
4. Repeat cycle 3-4 times before allowing ejaculation
5. **Effectiveness**: 45-60% with consistent practice

#### Squeeze Technique
1. Stimulate penis until close to ejaculation
2. Squeeze glans firmly for 10-20 seconds
3. Wait for arousal to decrease
4. Resume after 30 seconds
5. **Effectiveness**: 50-65% with consistent practice

#### Pelvic Floor Exercises (Kegels)
- **How**: Contract pelvic floor muscles as if stopping urination
- **Routine**: 3 sets of 10 reps, 3x daily
- **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for results
- **Effectiveness**: 40-50% improvement in some studies

**Behavioral Technique Tips**:
- Requires consistent practice over weeks/months
- Partner involvement improves success
- Often combined with medication for best results
- No cost, no side effects

### 6. Counseling and Sex Therapy

**Addresses Psychological Factors**

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Addresses anxiety and negative thought patterns
- **Sex therapy**: Teaches techniques and improves communication with partner
- **Couples counseling**: Involves partner in treatment process
- **Effectiveness**: 40-70% when psychological factors are primary cause

**Best for**:
- Performance anxiety-related PE
- Relationship issues contributing to PE
- Men who prefer non-medication approaches
