## What Are At-Home Health Tests?

At-home health tests allow you to collect samples (blood, urine, saliva) at home and mail them to a lab for analysis. Results are delivered online, often with telehealth consultation included.

**Common at-home tests:**
- Testosterone and hormone panels
- STD/STI screening
- Vitamin D and B12 levels
- Thyroid function
- Cholesterol and lipids
- HbA1c (diabetes screening)
- Food sensitivity
- COVID-19 and other infections

## When At-Home Testing Is Appropriate

### Routine Health Monitoring

**Good uses for at-home tests:**
- Annual wellness screening
- Monitoring known conditions (e.g., checking testosterone levels on TRT)
- Vitamin deficiency screening
- STD testing for peace of mind
- Pre-conception health assessment
- Tracking metrics over time

### Convenience and Privacy

**At-home testing makes sense when:**
- You want private STD screening
- You have limited time for doctor visits
- You're monitoring something regularly
- You live in rural area with limited lab access
- You want to check levels before seeing doctor

### Initial Screening

**Use at-home tests for:**
- Deciding if you need to see a doctor
- Understanding your baseline health
- Identifying potential issues
- Empowering yourself with health data

## When to See a Doctor Instead

### Serious Symptoms or Emergencies

**Don't use at-home tests if you have:**
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Severe abdominal pain
- Sudden changes in vision or speech
- Severe headache or neurological symptoms
- Any medical emergency

**Go to ER or call 911—don't wait for test results.**

### Complex Medical Conditions

**See a doctor in person for:**
- Multiple symptoms requiring comprehensive evaluation
- Chronic conditions needing ongoing management
- Situations requiring physical examination
- Complex diagnostic workups
- Mental health crises

### Follow-Up on Abnormal Results

**If at-home test shows problem:**
- See doctor for confirmation
- May need additional testing
- Requires treatment plan
- In-person evaluation often necessary
