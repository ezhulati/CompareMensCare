## What Are GLP-1 Medications?

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) medications are a class of injectable drugs originally developed for type 2 diabetes that have proven remarkably effective for weight loss. These medications mimic a natural hormone your body produces after eating, leading to reduced appetite, increased feelings of fullness, and significant weight loss.

**Popular GLP-1 medications:**
- **Semaglutide**: Ozempic (diabetes), Wegovy (weight loss)
- **Tirzepatide**: Mounjaro (diabetes), Zepbound (weight loss)
- **Liraglutide**: Victoza (diabetes), Saxenda (weight loss)

**Key facts:**
- Average weight loss: 15-20% of body weight
- FDA-approved for weight management
- Weekly injections (most)
- Require ongoing use to maintain results
- Prescription only

## How GLP-1 Medications Work

### The Science Behind GLP-1

**GLP-1 is a natural hormone** your intestines produce after eating. It:
1. Signals your brain that you're full
2. Slows stomach emptying (keeps you satisfied longer)
3. Reduces appetite and cravings
4. Helps regulate blood sugar

**GLP-1 medications are synthetic versions** that last much longer than natural GLP-1 (days vs. minutes), providing sustained appetite suppression and weight loss effects.

### Effects on Your Body

**Appetite and Satiety:**
- Dramatically reduces hunger
- Creates strong feeling of fullness with less food
- Reduces food cravings (especially for high-calorie foods)
- Some describe it as "food noise" going quiet

**Stomach and Digestion:**
- Slows gastric emptying (food stays in stomach longer)
- Increases satisfaction from smaller portions
- May cause nausea initially (usually improves)

**Blood Sugar:**
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Lowers blood sugar (beneficial for pre-diabetes/diabetes)
- Reduces HbA1c

**Weight Loss:**
- Average 15-20% total body weight loss
- More effective than lifestyle changes alone
- Most weight loss occurs in first 6-12 months

## Popular GLP-1 Medications Compared

### Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy)

**Ozempic:**
- FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes
- Widely prescribed off-label for weight loss
- Doses: 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg weekly

**Wegovy:**
- FDA-approved specifically for weight loss
- Same medication as Ozempic, higher doses
- Doses: 0.25mg up to 2.4mg weekly

**Clinical Results:**
- Average weight loss: **15% of body weight** (33 lbs if starting at 220 lbs)
- 68-week study: Lost 15.3 kg (33.7 lbs) vs. 2.6 kg (5.7 lbs) placebo
- ~70% of people lose 10%+ of body weight

**Administration:**
- Once-weekly subcutaneous injection
- Inject in abdomen, thigh, or upper arm

**Cost:**
- **Ozempic**: $900-1,000/month without insurance
- **Wegovy**: $1,300-1,500/month without insurance
- **Compounded semaglutide**: $200-400/month through telehealth

### Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound)

**Mounjaro:**
- FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes
- Often prescribed off-label for weight loss
- Doses: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 12.5mg, 15mg weekly

**Zepbound:**
- FDA-approved for weight loss (newer)
- Same medication as Mounjaro
- Doses: 2.5mg up to 15mg weekly

**Clinical Results:**

- 72-week study: Lost 20.9 kg (46 lbs) at highest dose
- More effective than semaglutide in head-to-head trials

**How it's different:**
- **Dual agonist**: Activates both GLP-1 and GIP receptors
- Generally more weight loss than semaglutide
- Potentially fewer GI side effects

**Cost:**
- **Mounjaro**: $1,000-1,100/month without insurance
- **Zepbound**: $1,000-1,200/month without insurance
- **Compounded tirzepatide**: $400-600/month through telehealth

### Liraglutide (Saxenda)

**Older GLP-1 medication:**
- Daily injection (not weekly)
- Effective but less convenient
- Average weight loss: 8-9% body weight
- Less popular since semaglutide/tirzepatide available

### Comparison Table

| Medication | Avg Weight Loss | Injection Frequency | Cost/Month | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| **Semaglutide** (Wegovy) | 15% body weight | Weekly | $1,300 | Most studied, effective |
| **Tirzepatide** (Zepbound) | 20% body weight | Weekly | $1,200 | Most effective, dual agonist |

- Use new needle each time
- Inject same day each week

**Reducing side effects:**
- Take with food in stomach (can reduce nausea)
- Stay well-hydrated

- Skin may appear saggy
- More noticeable in older individuals
- Not harmful, purely cosmetic

**Muscle loss:**
- GLP-1s cause fat AND muscle loss
- Resistance training recommended
- Adequate protein intake essential (1g per lb body weight)

**Gallstones:**
- Rapid weight loss increases gallstone risk
- ~3% develop gallstones

## Cost and Insurance Coverage

## Do You Need to Stay on GLP-1s Forever?

### The Reality of Long-Term Use

**Most weight regain occurs after stopping:**
- Studies show ~70% of weight comes back within a year of stopping
- Appetite returns to pre-treatment levels
- "Food noise" comes back

**Why this happens:**
- GLP-1s don't cure obesity—they manage it
- Underlying biology unchanged
- Think of it like blood pressure medication

**Current medical thinking:**
- **Obesity is a chronic disease** requiring ongoing treatment
- Most people need long-term or lifelong use
- Similar to diabetes or hypertension medications

### Can You Ever Stop?

**Some people successfully stop if:**
- They've established sustainable healthy habits
- Significant lifestyle changes made
- Close monitoring and early intervention if weight returns

**Strategies for stopping:**
- Very slow tapering (reduce dose gradually over months)
- Aggressive diet and exercise program
- Regular monitoring
- Restart early if weight trends upward

**Realistic expectations:**
- Most people need ongoing treatment
- Intermittent use may work for some
- Maintenance dose may be lower than weight loss dose

## GLP-1s vs. Other Weight Loss Approaches

### GLP-1s vs. Diet and Exercise Alone

**Diet/Exercise:**
- Average weight loss: 5-10% with intensive program
- Difficult to maintain long-term
- ~80% regain weight within 5 years

**GLP-1s + Lifestyle:**
- Average weight loss: 15-20%
- Better maintenance with continued use
- Makes diet/exercise much easier (reduced appetite)

**Conclusion:** GLP-1s are significantly more effective, but lifestyle still matters

### GLP-1s vs. Other Weight Loss Medications

**Phentermine:**
- Stimulant, suppresses appetite
- 5-7% weight loss
- Can't use long-term (tolerance, side effects)

**Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion):**
- 5-9% weight loss
- Oral medication
- Less effective than GLP-1s

**Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate):**
- 10-12% weight loss
- Can't use long-term

**GLP-1s are the most effective weight loss medications available.**

### GLP-1s vs. Bariatric Surgery

**Bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, sleeve):**
- Average weight loss: 25-30%
- One-time procedure
- Permanent anatomical change
- Risks of surgery
- Cost: $20,000-30,000
- Often covered by insurance

**GLP-1s:**
- 15-20% weight loss
- Ongoing medication
- Reversible
- No surgery
- Cost: $12,000-18,000/year
- Often not covered for weight loss

**Surgery still more effective for severe obesity (BMI >40).**

## The Bottom Line

**GLP-1 medications are highly effective for weight loss:**
- 15-20% body weight loss typical
- Most effective weight loss medications available
- FDA-approved and safe when properly used

**Best for:**
- BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with health conditions
- Those who've struggled with traditional weight loss
- People willing to commit to long-term use
- Those who can afford cost or have insurance coverage

**Considerations:**
- Expensive: $1,000-1,500/month brand-name, $200-600/month compounded
- Side effects common (mostly GI, usually temporary)
- Likely need ongoing use (not a cure)
- Require weekly injections
- Not covered by all insurance

**Most important:** GLP-1s are tools, not magic. They work best combined with healthy lifestyle changes. They make it dramatically easier to eat less and stick to a healthy diet, but they don't do the work for you.

**Talk to a healthcare provider** to determine if GLP-1 medications are right for your weight loss goals.
