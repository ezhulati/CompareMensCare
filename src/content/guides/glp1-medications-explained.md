keyTakeaways:
  - "GLP-1 medications (semaglutide, tirzepatide) produce 15-22% body weight loss by mimicking natural GLP-1 hormone, reducing appetite, slowing digestion, and increasing satiety after meals."
  - "Semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic) causes 15-17% weight loss on average; tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) is more effective with 20-22% average weight loss in clinical trials."
  - "FDA-approved for adults with BMI 30+ (obesity) or BMI 27+ with weight-related conditions (diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea)—not for cosmetic weight loss or BMI <27."
  - "Common side effects include nausea (40-50%), vomiting (10-20%), and diarrhea (20-30%)—usually mild, occur during dose escalation, and subside within 4-8 weeks of treatment."
  - "Cost: brand-name $900-1,400/month without insurance; compounded semaglutide $99-350/month; compounded tirzepatide $350-550/month through online weight loss clinics (Hims, Ro, Henry Meds)."
  - "GLP-1 medications require indefinite use—clinical trials show 70% of lost weight regained within 12 months of stopping; weight maintenance requires ongoing treatment or lifestyle changes."
faqs:
  - question: "How much weight can you lose on GLP-1 medications?"
    answer: "Average weight loss varies by medication: Semaglutide (Wegovy): 15-17% of body weight over 68 weeks (studies show 33-pound average for 200-pound person). Tirzepatide (Zepbound): 20-22% of body weight (44-pound average for 200-pound person). Liraglutide (Saxenda): 5-10% weight loss. Individual results vary—some lose 25-30%, others 8-12%. Maximum weight loss occurs at 12-18 months. Results depend on adherence, diet, exercise, and starting weight."
  - question: "What's the difference between Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound?"
    answer: "Ozempic and Wegovy: both contain semaglutide; Ozempic FDA-approved for diabetes (0.5-2mg weekly), Wegovy for weight loss (2.4mg weekly). Mounjaro and Zepbound: both contain tirzepatide; Mounjaro for diabetes (5-15mg weekly), Zepbound for weight loss (5-15mg weekly). They're identical medications marketed differently. Tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1) is more effective than semaglutide (GLP-1 only) but costs more. Many use diabetes versions off-label for weight loss at lower cost."
  - question: "How much do GLP-1 medications cost?"
    answer: "Brand-name prices: Wegovy/Ozempic $900-1,400/month without insurance. Mounjaro/Zepbound $1,000-1,400/month. With insurance: $25-100/month copay if covered. Compounded semaglutide (online clinics): $99-350/month. Compounded tirzepatide: $350-550/month. Providers: Hims ($199-299/month), Ro ($145-290/month), Henry Meds ($297/month), Noom ($149/month). Insurance rarely covers weight loss indication, often covers diabetes use. Compounded versions are legal, safe, and significantly cheaper."
  - question: "Are GLP-1 weight loss medications safe?"
    answer: "Yes, FDA-approved and considered safe for most people when prescribed appropriately. Common side effects (40-50% experience): nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation—usually mild and temporary. Serious risks (rare): pancreatitis (<1%), gallstones (1-2%), kidney problems, thyroid tumors (animal studies, unclear human risk). Not safe for: history of medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, pregnant/breastfeeding. Long-term safety data (5+ years) is still emerging. Benefits typically outweigh risks for obesity treatment."
  - question: "Do you have to inject GLP-1 medications?"
    answer: "Currently, yes—all FDA-approved GLP-1 medications for weight loss are injectable (semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide). Injections are subcutaneous (under skin, not into muscle), weekly for semaglutide/tirzepatide, daily for liraglutide. Injections use small needles (similar to insulin) in abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) exists for diabetes but not approved/effective for weight loss. Most users report injections are easy and painless after first few times. Pill versions are in development but not yet available."
  - question: "What happens when you stop taking GLP-1 medications?"
    answer: "Weight regain is common and expected. Clinical studies show: 70% of lost weight returns within 12 months of stopping. Appetite returns to pre-medication levels within 2-4 weeks. Some regain all weight lost, others maintain partial loss with lifestyle changes. To maintain weight loss after stopping: intensive lifestyle modification (diet, exercise), behavioral therapy, or transition to maintenance medication. Most doctors recommend indefinite use for obesity treatment, similar to managing chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension."
  - question: "Can anyone get a prescription for GLP-1 weight loss medication?"
    answer: "No, FDA approval requires: BMI 30+ (obesity), OR BMI 27+ with at least one weight-related condition (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, PCOS). Not approved for: cosmetic weight loss, BMI <27 without medical conditions, people at healthy weight wanting to lose 5-10 pounds. Contraindications: pregnancy, history of medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Legitimate telehealth providers verify BMI and medical eligibility before prescribing."
  - question: "How long does it take for GLP-1 medications to work for weight loss?"
    answer: "Timeline for results: 2-4 weeks: reduced appetite, smaller portions, early weight loss (2-5 pounds). 4-8 weeks: noticeable weight loss (5-10 pounds), nausea typically subsides. 3-6 months: significant weight loss (10-15% of body weight). 12-18 months: peak weight loss (15-22% depending on medication). Weight loss continues for 12-18 months, then plateaus. Slower results at lower doses—dose escalation occurs over 4-5 months to minimize side effects."
  - question: "What are the side effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide?"
    answer: "Common side effects (frequency): Nausea (40-50%), diarrhea (20-30%), vomiting (10-20%), constipation (15-20%), abdominal pain (10%), fatigue (10%), headache (10%). Most side effects: occur during dose escalation, peak at weeks 2-4, subside by week 8-12, are mild to moderate. Strategies to reduce: slow dose increases, eat smaller meals, avoid fatty foods, stay hydrated. Serious but rare: pancreatitis (<1%), gallstones (1-2%), severe dehydration from vomiting. About 5-10% discontinue due to intolerable side effects."
  - question: "Is compounded semaglutide as effective as Wegovy?"
    answer: "Yes, compounded semaglutide contains the same active ingredient (semaglutide) at identical doses and is equally effective for weight loss. Differences: Compounded versions are made by FDA-registered 503B compounding pharmacies (legal and regulated), cost $99-350/month vs $900-1,400 for brand-name, may have slightly different inactive ingredients. The FDA allows compounding due to Wegovy shortages. Effectiveness is the same—15-17% average weight loss. However, compounded versions lack the same FDA approval process as brand-name medications."

## What Are GLP-1 Medications?

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) medications are a class of injectable drugs originally developed for type 2 diabetes that have proven remarkably effective for weight loss. These medications mimic a natural hormone your body produces after eating, leading to reduced appetite, increased feelings of fullness, and significant weight loss.

**Popular GLP-1 medications:**
- **Semaglutide**: Ozempic (diabetes), Wegovy (weight loss)
- **Tirzepatide**: Mounjaro (diabetes), Zepbound (weight loss)
- **Liraglutide**: Victoza (diabetes), Saxenda (weight loss)

**Key facts:**
- Average weight loss: 15-20% of body weight
- FDA-approved for weight management
- Weekly injections (most)
- Require ongoing use to maintain results
- Prescription only

## How GLP-1 Medications Work

### The Science Behind GLP-1

**GLP-1 is a natural hormone** your intestines produce after eating. It:
1. Signals your brain that you're full
2. Slows stomach emptying (keeps you satisfied longer)
3. Reduces appetite and cravings
4. Helps regulate blood sugar

**GLP-1 medications are synthetic versions** that last much longer than natural GLP-1 (days vs. minutes), providing sustained appetite suppression and weight loss effects.

### Effects on Your Body

**Appetite and Satiety:**
- Dramatically reduces hunger
- Creates strong feeling of fullness with less food
- Reduces food cravings (especially for high-calorie foods)
- Some describe it as "food noise" going quiet

**Stomach and Digestion:**
- Slows gastric emptying (food stays in stomach longer)
- Increases satisfaction from smaller portions
- May cause nausea initially (usually improves)

**Blood Sugar:**
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- Lowers blood sugar (beneficial for pre-diabetes/diabetes)
- Reduces HbA1c

**Weight Loss:**
- Average 15-20% total body weight loss
- More effective than lifestyle changes alone
- Most weight loss occurs in first 6-12 months

## Popular GLP-1 Medications Compared

### Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy)

**Ozempic:**
- FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes
- Widely prescribed off-label for weight loss

- Same medication as Ozempic, higher doses
- Doses: 0.25mg up to 2.4mg weekly

**Clinical Results:**
- Average weight loss: **15% of body weight** (33 lbs if starting at 220 lbs)
- 68-week study: Lost 15.3 kg (33.7 lbs) vs. 2.6 kg (5.7 lbs) placebo
- ~70% of people lose 10%+ of body weight

**Administration:**
- Once-weekly subcutaneous injection
- Inject in abdomen, thigh, or upper arm

**Cost:**

## Do You Need to Stay on GLP-1s Forever?

### The Reality of Long-Term Use

**Most weight regain occurs after stopping:**
- Studies show ~70% of weight comes back within a year of stopping
- Appetite returns to pre-treatment levels
- "Food noise" comes back

**Why this happens:**
- GLP-1s don't cure obesity—they manage it
- Underlying biology unchanged
- Think of it like blood pressure medication

**Current medical thinking:**
- **Obesity is a chronic disease** requiring ongoing treatment
- Most people need long-term or lifelong use
- Similar to diabetes or hypertension medications

### Can You Ever Stop?

**Some people successfully stop if:**
- They've established sustainable healthy habits
- Significant lifestyle changes made
- Close monitoring and early intervention if weight returns

**Strategies for stopping:**
- Very slow tapering (reduce dose gradually over months)
- Aggressive diet and exercise program
- Regular monitoring
- Restart early if weight trends upward

**Realistic expectations:**
- Most people need ongoing treatment
- Intermittent use may work for some
- Maintenance dose may be lower than weight loss dose

## GLP-1s vs. Other Weight Loss Approaches

### GLP-1s vs. Diet and Exercise Alone

**Diet/Exercise:**
- Average weight loss: 5-10% with intensive program
- Difficult to maintain long-term
- ~80% regain weight within 5 years

**GLP-1s + Lifestyle:**
- Average weight loss: 15-20%
- Better maintenance with continued use
- Makes diet/exercise much easier (reduced appetite)

**Conclusion:** GLP-1s are significantly more effective, but lifestyle still matters

### GLP-1s vs. Other Weight Loss Medications

**Phentermine:**
- Stimulant, suppresses appetite
- 5-7% weight loss
- Can't use long-term (tolerance, side effects)

**Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion):**
- 5-9% weight loss
- Oral medication
- Less effective than GLP-1s

**Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate):**
- 10-12% weight loss
- Can't use long-term

**GLP-1s are the most effective weight loss medications available.**

### GLP-1s vs. Bariatric Surgery

**Bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, sleeve):**
- Average weight loss: 25-30%
- One-time procedure
- Permanent anatomical change
- Risks of surgery
- Cost: $20,000-30,000
- Often covered by insurance

**GLP-1s:**
- 15-20% weight loss
- Ongoing medication
- Reversible
- No surgery
- Cost: $12,000-18,000/year
- Often not covered for weight loss

**Surgery still more effective for severe obesity (BMI >40).**

## The Bottom Line

**GLP-1 medications are highly effective for weight loss:**
- 15-20% body weight loss typical
- Most effective weight loss medications available
- FDA-approved and safe when properly used

**Best for:**
- BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with health conditions
- Those who've struggled with traditional weight loss
- People willing to commit to long-term use
- Those who can afford cost or have insurance coverage

**Considerations:**
- Expensive: $1,000-1,500/month brand-name, $200-600/month compounded
- Side effects common (mostly GI, usually temporary)
- Likely need ongoing use (not a cure)
- Require weekly injections
- Not covered by all insurance

**Most important:** GLP-1s are tools, not magic. They work best combined with healthy lifestyle changes. They make it dramatically easier to eat less and stick to a healthy diet, but they don't do the work for you.

**Talk to a healthcare provider** to determine if GLP-1 medications are right for your weight loss goals.
