keyTakeaways:
  - "Sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis) are equally effective (70-85% success rates) with identical mechanisms—both are PDE5 inhibitors that increase blood flow to the penis during sexual arousal."
  - "The primary difference is duration: sildenafil lasts 4-6 hours (planned sex), while tadalafil lasts up to 36 hours (weekend pill), allowing greater spontaneity."
  - "Tadalafil offers daily low-dose options (2.5-5mg) for complete spontaneity without planning, while sildenafil is only available for on-demand use 30-60 minutes before sex."
  - "Food interactions matter: high-fat meals delay sildenafil absorption by 60+ minutes, while tadalafil is minimally affected—take tadalafil with or without food."
  - "Side effects are similar (headache 15-20%, flushing 10-15%, nasal congestion 10%), but tadalafil more commonly causes back/muscle aches (10-15% vs 2-4% with sildenafil)."
  - "Generic prices are comparable at $2-10/dose, making the choice primarily about lifestyle preference: sildenafil for planned intimacy, tadalafil for flexibility and spontaneity."
faqs:
  - question: "Which is better: sildenafil or tadalafil?"
    answer: "Neither is objectively better—both are 70-85% effective for ED with identical mechanisms. Choose based on lifestyle: sildenafil (4-6 hours) works best for planned sex with precise timing; tadalafil (36 hours) offers spontaneity and flexibility. Tadalafil also has daily-use options (2.5-5mg) for complete spontaneity. If you prefer not timing sex precisely or want weekend-long effectiveness, choose tadalafil. For planned encounters or if you prefer shorter duration, choose sildenafil."
  - question: "Can I switch between sildenafil and tadalafil?"
    answer: "Yes, you can safely switch between the two medications or alternate based on situation. Many men try both to determine personal preference. Wait at least 24 hours between doses when switching. Some men use tadalafil for weekends (long duration) and sildenafil for weeknight planned encounters (shorter duration). Consult your doctor before switching, especially if you have cardiovascular conditions or take other medications."
  - question: "Does tadalafil work better than sildenafil for older men?"
    answer: "Both work equally well in older men (70-85% effectiveness regardless of age, assuming vascular health). Tadalafil may be preferred by older men for practical reasons: daily low-dose option eliminates planning, longer duration accommodates slower arousal, and it treats BPH urinary symptoms (FDA-approved at 5mg daily). Effectiveness depends more on overall health and ED cause than age."
  - question: "How much do sildenafil and tadalafil cost?"
    answer: "Generic prices are similar: sildenafil $2-8/dose, tadalafil $2.50-10/dose through online telehealth services. Brand-name Viagra and Cialis cost significantly more at $70-90/dose. Daily tadalafil (2.5-5mg, 30 tablets) costs $30-60/month. Most online services (Hims, Ro, BlueChew) offer subscriptions at $44-95/month for on-demand treatment or $30-50/month for daily tadalafil. Insurance rarely covers ED medication."
  - question: "Can I take sildenafil and tadalafil together?"
    answer: "No, never take sildenafil and tadalafil together or within 24 hours of each other. Both are PDE5 inhibitors—combining them significantly increases risk of dangerous side effects including severe hypotension (low blood pressure), priapism (prolonged painful erection), and cardiovascular complications. If one doesn't work well, try higher doses of that medication or switch entirely, but don't combine them."
  - question: "Which has fewer side effects: sildenafil or tadalafil?"
    answer: "Side effects are similar in frequency and severity. Both cause headache (15-20%), flushing (10-15%), and nasal congestion (10%). Tadalafil more commonly causes back pain and muscle aches (10-15% vs 2-4% with sildenafil). Sildenafil more often causes visual disturbances (blue tinge, light sensitivity) in 3-5% of users vs 1-2% with tadalafil. Neither is clearly better for side effects—individual response varies."
  - question: "Does food affect sildenafil and tadalafil differently?"
    answer: "Yes, significantly. High-fat meals delay sildenafil absorption by 60+ minutes and reduce peak effectiveness by 30-40%—take on empty stomach or after light meal. Tadalafil is minimally affected by food and can be taken with or without meals. This makes tadalafil more convenient for spontaneous situations where you can't control meal timing. If using sildenafil, avoid heavy/fatty meals within 2 hours of dosing."
  - question: "Is daily tadalafil more effective than on-demand sildenafil?"
    answer: "Daily tadalafil (2.5-5mg) maintains steady medication levels, allowing spontaneous erections anytime without planning. On-demand sildenafil (50-100mg) provides higher peak levels when needed. Effectiveness is similar (70-85%), but daily tadalafil offers lifestyle advantages: no planning, continuous readiness, and may improve vascular health over time. Daily tadalafil costs $30-60/month vs on-demand sildenafil at $44-85/month for 6-8 doses."
  - question: "How long does it take for sildenafil vs tadalafil to work?"
    answer: "Both typically work in 30-60 minutes, with tadalafil sometimes slightly faster at 30 minutes. However, sildenafil's window is narrower (peak effectiveness at 60 minutes, declining after 4-6 hours), while tadalafil maintains effectiveness for 36 hours. For fastest results with sildenafil, take on empty stomach 60 minutes before sex. Tadalafil can be taken anytime within 36 hours before anticipated sexual activity."
  - question: "Which medication lasts longer in your system?"
    answer: "Tadalafil lasts significantly longer: up to 36 hours of effectiveness vs sildenafil's 4-6 hours. This is due to tadalafil's longer half-life (17.5 hours vs 4 hours for sildenafil). The medication remains in your system at therapeutic levels for 1.5 days with tadalafil (earning the nickname 'weekend pill'), while sildenafil is mostly cleared within 12 hours. Choose based on desired duration: sildenafil for shorter, planned encounters; tadalafil for extended flexibility."

## How They Work

### Same Mechanism, Different Duration

Both medications are **PDE5 inhibitors** (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). Here's how they work:

1. **During sexual arousal**, the body releases nitric oxide in the penis
2. Nitric oxide activates an enzyme that produces **cGMP**, which relaxes smooth muscles and allows blood to flow into the penis
3. Normally, an enzyme called **PDE5 breaks down cGMP**, ending the erection
4. **Sildenafil and tadalafil block PDE5**, allowing cGMP levels to remain high, maintaining blood flow and facilitating an erection

**Important**: Both medications require sexual stimulation to work. They don't cause automatic erections.
