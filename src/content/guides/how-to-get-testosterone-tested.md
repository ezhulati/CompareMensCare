summary: "Testosterone testing requires fasting morning blood draw (7-11 AM) when levels peak 20-30% higher than afternoon. Normal range: 300-1000 ng/dL total testosterone, with levels below 300 ng/dL indicating low T (hypogonadism). Two separate tests showing low levels plus symptoms are required for TRT diagnosis. Testing costs $29-150 through at-home kits (Hone Health, Vault Health) or $50-200 at doctor's office/labs."
summaryPoints:
  - "Test between 7-11 AM when testosterone peaks—afternoon levels are 20-30% lower, potentially causing misdiagnosis"
  - "Fast 8-12 hours before test and avoid exercise 24 hours prior for accurate results—alcohol and stress also lower readings"
  - "Normal: 300-1000 ng/dL total T; Low: below 300 ng/dL; Optimal: 500-800 ng/dL; also test free testosterone (active form)"
  - "At-home test kits ($29-99) mail finger-prick sample to labs; doctor visits ($50-200) or online TRT clinics ($0-99) provide comprehensive panels"

keyTakeaways:
  - "Test testosterone between 7-11 AM when levels peak 20-30% higher than afternoon—improper timing causes falsely low results and potential misdiagnosis."
  - "Normal total testosterone: 300-1000 ng/dL; low T: below 300 ng/dL; optimal: 500-800 ng/dL; also measure free testosterone (9-30 ng/dL) which is the active form."
  - "Two separate morning tests showing levels below 300 ng/dL plus symptoms (fatigue, low libido, erectile dysfunction) are required for low T diagnosis—single test insufficient."
  - "Preparation matters: fast 8-12 hours, avoid exercise 24 hours prior, minimize stress, avoid alcohol 48 hours before—these factors significantly affect results."
  - "Testing options: at-home kits ($29-99, finger-prick sample mailed to lab), doctor's office ($50-200 with insurance), or online TRT clinics ($0-99 including comprehensive panel)."
  - "Comprehensive panel should include total testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, LH, FSH, and prolactin—not just total T—to identify root cause of low levels."
faqs:
  - question: "What time of day should I test testosterone?"
    answer: "Test between 7-11 AM when testosterone levels peak, ideally 8-10 AM. Morning levels are 20-30% higher than afternoon/evening. Testing at 2 PM could show 350 ng/dL when your true morning level is 480 ng/dL (normal), potentially leading to misdiagnosis. Testosterone follows circadian rhythm, peaking in morning and declining throughout day. Consistent timing (same time for both confirmatory tests) ensures accuracy. Most clinics and at-home kits specify morning collection."
  - question: "How much does testosterone testing cost?"
    answer: "At-home test kits: $29-99 for basic total T, $79-149 for comprehensive panel (LetsGetChecked, Everlywell, Hone Health). Doctor's office: $50-200 with insurance copay, $100-300 without insurance. Quest/LabCorp walk-in: $69-150 for testosterone panel. Online TRT clinics: $0-99 for initial comprehensive panel when enrolling (Hone, Vault, Maximus). Insurance typically covers testing if symptomatic but may require doctor referral. At-home kits often cheapest option for quick screening."
  - question: "What is a normal testosterone level for men?"
    answer: "Normal total testosterone: 300-1000 ng/dL (most labs). Optimal range: 500-800 ng/dL. Low T (hypogonadism): below 300 ng/dL. Borderline: 250-350 ng/dL. Free testosterone (active form): 9-30 ng/dL. Levels decline 1-2% per year after age 30. Age-adjusted ranges: 20s-30s: 500-900 ng/dL average; 40s-50s: 400-700 ng/dL; 60s+: 300-600 ng/dL. However, symptoms matter more than specific number—some men feel fine at 350 ng/dL, others symptomatic at 450 ng/dL."
  - question: "Do I need to fast before a testosterone test?"
    answer: "Yes, fast 8-12 hours before testing for most accurate results. Food, especially high-fat meals, can temporarily lower testosterone readings by 10-30%. Water is allowed and encouraged. However, some at-home kits don't require fasting. If testing includes glucose or cholesterol (common in comprehensive panels), fasting is mandatory. Coffee without cream/sugar is usually okay. For best accuracy: eat normal dinner, fast overnight, test first thing in morning before breakfast."
  - question: "Can I test my testosterone at home?"
    answer: "Yes, at-home testosterone test kits are accurate and convenient. How they work: order kit online ($29-149), finger-prick blood sample at home (morning 7-11 AM), mail to CLIA-certified lab, results in 2-5 days via secure portal. Accuracy comparable to venous blood draw (95-98% correlation). Comprehensive kits test total T, free T, SHBG, estradiol. Reputable providers: Hone Health, Vault Health, Everlywell, LetsGetChecked. Advantage: privacy, convenience, often cheaper than doctor visit."
  - question: "What else should be tested with testosterone?"
    answer: "Comprehensive male hormone panel includes: Total testosterone (main marker), Free testosterone (active form, 9-30 ng/dL normal), SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin, affects free T), Estradiol (E2, testosterone converts to estrogen), LH and FSH (pituitary hormones controlling T production), Prolactin (high levels suppress T), and often DHT (dihydrotestosterone). Complete panel identifies root cause: primary hypogonadism (testicular), secondary (pituitary/brain), or other factors. Testing only total T misses important information."
  - question: "How many times should I test testosterone before starting TRT?"
    answer: "Medical guidelines require TWO separate morning tests showing low levels (below 300 ng/dL) before diagnosing hypogonadism and prescribing TRT. Tests should be 2-4 weeks apart to account for natural fluctuation. Single low test is insufficient—could be stress, illness, poor sleep, or lab error. Reputable TRT clinics require two confirmatory tests. Once on TRT, test every 3-6 months to monitor levels and adjust dosing. Quick single-test TRT prescriptions from some online clinics don't follow medical guidelines."
  - question: "What can cause falsely low testosterone results?"
    answer: "Common causes of inaccurate low readings: testing in afternoon/evening (20-30% lower), not fasting (10-30% decrease), exercising within 24 hours (temporary suppression), acute illness or stress (cortisol suppresses T), poor sleep (lack of sleep lowers T 10-15%), alcohol within 48 hours (suppresses production), certain medications (opioids, steroids), recent sexual activity (temporary dip). For accurate results: test 7-11 AM, fast overnight, well-rested, unstressed, healthy, no alcohol 48 hours prior."
  - question: "Can testosterone levels fluctuate from day to day?"
    answer: "Yes, testosterone can vary 10-30% day-to-day due to sleep quality, stress, diet, exercise, illness, and circadian rhythm. Week-to-week variation is typically 15-20%. This is why TWO separate tests are required for diagnosis. A single test showing 280 ng/dL doesn't confirm low T—you might test 350 ng/dL next week. However, large fluctuations (e.g., 400 ng/dL to 600 ng/dL) are unusual and may indicate testing errors or inconsistent timing. Consistent low results (<300 ng/dL) on multiple morning tests confirm true hypogonadism."
  - question: "Should I stop taking supplements before testosterone testing?"
    answer: "Yes, stop certain supplements 48-72 hours before testing that may affect results: DHEA (converts to testosterone), testosterone boosters (ashwagandha, tribulus, fenugreek—minimal effect but stop to be safe), zinc (high doses affect readings), vitamin D (affects hormones). Continue normal medications unless doctor advises otherwise. Don't stop prescription TRT if you're already on it (testing measures different things on TRT). For initial diagnostic testing, present your natural baseline without supplements for accurate diagnosis."

## How to Prepare for Testosterone Testing

### Timing is Critical

**Test in the MORNING (8-10 AM):**
- Testosterone peaks in early morning
- Levels drop throughout the day
- Afternoon testing can give falsely low results
- **Testing at wrong time can lead to misdiagnosis**

**Example:**
- Morning (8 AM): 600 ng/dL (normal)
- Afternoon (4 PM): 400 ng/dL (appears low)

**Same person, but afternoon test looks like hypogonadism!**

### Preparation Checklist

**The Night Before:**
- Get adequate sleep (poor sleep lowers T)
- Avoid heavy alcohol consumption
- Fast for 8-12 hours (water is okay)

**Day of Test:**
- Schedule for 8-10 AM
- Fasting (no food, only water)
- Well-rested
- Avoid intense exercise before test

**Before Blood Draw:**
- Avoid working out that morning
- Be well-hydrated (makes blood draw easier)
- Sit down and relax for 10 minutes

### Tests to Request

**Comprehensive Hormone Panel Should Include:**

**Essential:**
- **Total Testosterone**
- **Free Testosterone** (or calculated)
- **Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)**

**Additional Important Tests:**
- **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**—pituitary function
- **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**—fertility marker
- **Estradiol (E2)**—estrogen levels
- **Prolactin**—can suppress T if elevated
- **Thyroid Panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4)**—thyroid affects energy
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**—baseline
- **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**—kidney, liver function
- **Lipid Panel**—cholesterol
- **Hemoglobin A1c**—blood sugar
- **Vitamin D**—often low, affects T production

**Don't just test total T alone—you need the full picture.**

## Understanding Your Results

### Testosterone Reference Ranges

**Note:** Ranges vary by lab, age, and measurement method. These are general guidelines.

#### Total Testosterone

| Range | ng/dL | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Optimal** | 700-1,000+ | Healthy, youthful levels |
| **Normal** | 300-700 | Within reference range but may have symptoms if <500 |
| **Low-Normal** | 300-400 | Technically "normal" but often symptomatic |
| **Low** | 200-300 | Clinically low (hypogonadism) |
| **Very Low** | <200 | Severely low, requires investigation |

**Important:** Reference range is often 300-1,000 ng/dL, but this is based on population averages including older men. Optimal for most men is 600-900 ng/dL.

#### Free Testosterone

**Free T** is testosterone not bound to proteins—the biologically active form.

| Range | ng/dL | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Optimal** | 12-25 | Upper-normal range |
| **Normal** | 5-21 | Reference range |
| **Low** | <5 | Below normal, symptoms likely |

**Free T can be low even if total T is normal** (due to high SHBG binding more testosterone).

### Other Important Markers

**SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin):**
- Normal: 10-50 nmol/L
- High SHBG binds more T, reducing free T
- Low SHBG increases free T (but may indicate metabolic issues)

**LH (Luteinizing Hormone):**
- Normal: 1.5-9.3 mIU/mL
- **High LH + Low T** = Primary hypogonadism (testicle problem)
- **Low LH + Low T** = Secondary hypogonadism (brain/pituitary problem)

**Estradiol (E2):**
- Men: 10-40 pg/mL
- Too high: Can cause low libido, ED, breast tissue, water retention
- Too low: Joint pain, low libido (estrogen is important for men too!)

**Prolactin:**
- Normal: <15 ng/mL
- Elevated prolactin suppresses testosterone and libido
- If high, check for pituitary tumor (usually benign, treatable)

### What Do Your Numbers Mean?

**Scenario 1: Total T = 800 ng/dL, Free T = 18 ng/dL**
- **Excellent levels**, unlikely to benefit from TRT
- Look for other causes of symptoms if present

**Scenario 2: Total T = 350 ng/dL, Free T = 6 ng/dL**
- **Low-normal total T, low free T**
- Symptoms likely related to testosterone
- Candidate for TRT if symptomatic

**Scenario 3: Total T = 500 ng/dL, SHBG = 60, Free T = 4 ng/dL**
- Total T looks okay, but **high SHBG reduces free T**
- May be symptomatic despite "normal" total T
- Candidate for TRT

**Scenario 4: Total T = 250 ng/dL, LH = 12 (high)**
- **Primary hypogonadism**—testicles not responding to LH
- Definite TRT candidate
- Check for underlying causes

**Scenario 5: Total T = 250 ng/dL, LH = 2 (low), Prolactin = 35 (high)**
- **Secondary hypogonadism** due to elevated prolactin
- Need to treat prolactin first (may normalize T)
- Check for pituitary tumor

## What To Do If Your Testosterone Is Low

### Step 1: Confirm with Repeat Test

**One low test is not enough for diagnosis.**

- Retest on a separate day (morning, fasted)
- Testosterone fluctuates day-to-day
- Need two low tests to confirm

### Step 2: Identify Underlying Causes

**Potentially reversible causes of low T:**
- **Obesity**—weight loss can raise T significantly
- **Sleep apnea**—treatment raises T
- **Medications**—opioids, steroids, others lower T
- **Chronic illness**—diabetes, liver disease, etc.
- **Stress and poor sleep**
- **Excessive alcohol**
- **Nutrient deficiencies**—vitamin D, zinc

**Address lifestyle factors first, then retest.**

### Step 3: Consider Treatment Options

**If T remains low after addressing lifestyle:**

**TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy):**
- Most effective treatment
- Restores levels to normal
- See our guide: [What Is TRT](/guides/what-is-testosterone-replacement-therapy)

**Alternatives to TRT:**
- **Clomiphene/Enclomiphene**—stimulates natural T production
- **HCG**—maintains testicular function
- Better for younger men or those wanting fertility

**Lifestyle optimization:**
- Weight loss
- Strength training
- Sleep improvement
- Stress management

## What If Your Testosterone Is Borderline (300-500 ng/dL)?

**This "gray zone" is common and controversial.**

### Medical Perspective

- **Some doctors**: "You're within normal range, no treatment"
- **Others**: "Normal for 70-year-old, not 35-year-old, let's treat symptoms"

### Practical Approach

**If you're symptomatic at 300-500 ng/dL:**
1. **Try lifestyle optimization first** (3-6 months):
   - Lose weight if overweight
   - Strength train 3-4x per week
   - Optimize sleep (7-9 hours)
   - Manage stress
   - Supplement vitamin D if low
2. **Retest after lifestyle changes**
3. **If still symptomatic**, consider trial of TRT
   - Monitor symptoms and quality of life
   - Continue if beneficial, stop if not helpful

**"Treat the patient, not just the number."**

## Common Testing Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Testing at wrong time of day**
- Test in morning (8-10 AM) only

**❌ Testing only total testosterone**
- Need free T, SHBG, and other hormones

**❌ Single test and immediate treatment**
- Requires two low tests to confirm

**❌ Ignoring underlying causes**
- Address obesity, sleep apnea, medications first

**❌ Testing after poor sleep or heavy drinking**
- Can artificially lower results

**❌ Testing right after intense workout**
- Wait at least 24 hours after hard exercise

## Cost Breakdown

### Traditional Doctor Route
- Doctor visit (without insurance): $100-300
- Blood work (comprehensive panel): $100-400
- Follow-up visit: $100-300
- **Total**: $300-1,000

### At-Home Test Kits
