## When to Get Your Testosterone Tested

### Symptoms That Warrant Testing

**Sexual symptoms:**
- Low libido (reduced sex drive)
- Erectile dysfunction
- Reduced spontaneous erections (fewer morning erections)

**Physical symptoms:**
- Persistent fatigue and low energy

- Increased body fat, especially around midsection
- Reduced bone density
- Loss of body hair

**Psychological symptoms:**
- Depression or persistent low mood
- Anxiety

**If you have multiple symptoms, testing is warranted.**

### Age Considerations

**Under 30:**

## How to Prepare for Testosterone Testing

### Timing is Critical

**Test in the MORNING (8-10 AM):**
- Testosterone peaks in early morning
- Levels drop throughout the day
- Afternoon testing can give falsely low results
- **Testing at wrong time can lead to misdiagnosis**

**Example:**
- Morning (8 AM): 600 ng/dL (normal)
- Afternoon (4 PM): 400 ng/dL (appears low)

**Same person, but afternoon test looks like hypogonadism!**

### Preparation Checklist

**The Night Before:**
- Get adequate sleep (poor sleep lowers T)
- Avoid heavy alcohol consumption
- Fast for 8-12 hours (water is okay)

**Day of Test:**
- Schedule for 8-10 AM
- Fasting (no food, only water)
- Well-rested
- Avoid intense exercise before test

**Before Blood Draw:**
- Avoid working out that morning
- Be well-hydrated (makes blood draw easier)
- Sit down and relax for 10 minutes

### Tests to Request

**Comprehensive Hormone Panel Should Include:**

**Essential:**
- **Total Testosterone**
- **Free Testosterone** (or calculated)
- **Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)**

**Additional Important Tests:**
- **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**—pituitary function
- **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**—fertility marker
- **Estradiol (E2)**—estrogen levels
- **Prolactin**—can suppress T if elevated
- **Thyroid Panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4)**—thyroid affects energy
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**—baseline
- **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**—kidney, liver function
- **Lipid Panel**—cholesterol
- **Hemoglobin A1c**—blood sugar
- **Vitamin D**—often low, affects T production

**Don't just test total T alone—you need the full picture.**

## Understanding Your Results

### Testosterone Reference Ranges

**Note:** Ranges vary by lab, age, and measurement method. These are general guidelines.

#### Total Testosterone

| Range | ng/dL | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Optimal** | 700-1,000+ | Healthy, youthful levels |
| **Normal** | 300-700 | Within reference range but may have symptoms if <500 |
| **Low-Normal** | 300-400 | Technically "normal" but often symptomatic |
| **Low** | 200-300 | Clinically low (hypogonadism) |
| **Very Low** | <200 | Severely low, requires investigation |

**Important:** Reference range is often 300-1,000 ng/dL, but this is based on population averages including older men. Optimal for most men is 600-900 ng/dL.

#### Free Testosterone

**Free T** is testosterone not bound to proteins—the biologically active form.

| Range | ng/dL | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Optimal** | 12-25 | Upper-normal range |
| **Normal** | 5-21 | Reference range |
| **Low** | <5 | Below normal, symptoms likely |

**Free T can be low even if total T is normal** (due to high SHBG binding more testosterone).

### Other Important Markers

**SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin):**
- Normal: 10-50 nmol/L
- High SHBG binds more T, reducing free T
- Low SHBG increases free T (but may indicate metabolic issues)

**LH (Luteinizing Hormone):**
- Normal: 1.5-9.3 mIU/mL
- **High LH + Low T** = Primary hypogonadism (testicle problem)
- **Low LH + Low T** = Secondary hypogonadism (brain/pituitary problem)

**Estradiol (E2):**
- Men: 10-40 pg/mL
- Too high: Can cause low libido, ED, breast tissue, water retention
- Too low: Joint pain, low libido (estrogen is important for men too!)

**Prolactin:**
- Normal: <15 ng/mL
- Elevated prolactin suppresses testosterone and libido
- If high, check for pituitary tumor (usually benign, treatable)

### What Do Your Numbers Mean?

**Scenario 1: Total T = 800 ng/dL, Free T = 18 ng/dL**
- **Excellent levels**, unlikely to benefit from TRT
- Look for other causes of symptoms if present

**Scenario 2: Total T = 350 ng/dL, Free T = 6 ng/dL**
- **Low-normal total T, low free T**
- Symptoms likely related to testosterone
- Candidate for TRT if symptomatic

**Scenario 3: Total T = 500 ng/dL, SHBG = 60, Free T = 4 ng/dL**
- Total T looks okay, but **high SHBG reduces free T**
- May be symptomatic despite "normal" total T
- Candidate for TRT

**Scenario 4: Total T = 250 ng/dL, LH = 12 (high)**
- **Primary hypogonadism**—testicles not responding to LH
- Definite TRT candidate
- Check for underlying causes

**Scenario 5: Total T = 250 ng/dL, LH = 2 (low), Prolactin = 35 (high)**
- **Secondary hypogonadism** due to elevated prolactin
- Need to treat prolactin first (may normalize T)
- Check for pituitary tumor

## What To Do If Your Testosterone Is Low

### Step 1: Confirm with Repeat Test

**One low test is not enough for diagnosis.**

- Retest on a separate day (morning, fasted)
- Testosterone fluctuates day-to-day
- Need two low tests to confirm

### Step 2: Identify Underlying Causes

**Potentially reversible causes of low T:**
- **Obesity**—weight loss can raise T significantly
- **Sleep apnea**—treatment raises T
- **Medications**—opioids, steroids, others lower T
- **Chronic illness**—diabetes, liver disease, etc.
- **Stress and poor sleep**
- **Excessive alcohol**
- **Nutrient deficiencies**—vitamin D, zinc

**Address lifestyle factors first, then retest.**

### Step 3: Consider Treatment Options

**If T remains low after addressing lifestyle:**

**TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy):**
- Most effective treatment
- Restores levels to normal
- See our guide: [What Is TRT](/guides/what-is-testosterone-replacement-therapy)

**Alternatives to TRT:**
- **Clomiphene/Enclomiphene**—stimulates natural T production
- **HCG**—maintains testicular function
- Better for younger men or those wanting fertility

**Lifestyle optimization:**
- Weight loss
- Strength training
- Sleep improvement
- Stress management

## What If Your Testosterone Is Borderline (300-500 ng/dL)?

**This "gray zone" is common and controversial.**

### Medical Perspective

- **Some doctors**: "You're within normal range, no treatment"
- **Others**: "Normal for 70-year-old, not 35-year-old, let's treat symptoms"

### Practical Approach

**If you're symptomatic at 300-500 ng/dL:**
1. **Try lifestyle optimization first** (3-6 months):
   - Lose weight if overweight
   - Strength train 3-4x per week
   - Optimize sleep (7-9 hours)
   - Manage stress
   - Supplement vitamin D if low
2. **Retest after lifestyle changes**
3. **If still symptomatic**, consider trial of TRT
   - Monitor symptoms and quality of life
   - Continue if beneficial, stop if not helpful

**"Treat the patient, not just the number."**

## Common Testing Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Testing at wrong time of day**
- Test in morning (8-10 AM) only

**❌ Testing only total testosterone**
- Need free T, SHBG, and other hormones

**❌ Single test and immediate treatment**
- Requires two low tests to confirm

**❌ Ignoring underlying causes**
- Address obesity, sleep apnea, medications first

**❌ Testing after poor sleep or heavy drinking**
- Can artificially lower results

**❌ Testing right after intense workout**
- Wait at least 24 hours after hard exercise
