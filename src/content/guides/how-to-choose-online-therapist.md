## What to Look For in an Online Therapist

**Essential Credentials:** Look for licensed professionals (LCSW, LMFT, LPC, PhD/PsyD) who are licensed in your state.

**Specializations:** Match therapist expertise to your needs (anxiety, trauma, relationships, etc.).

**Therapy Approach:** Common evidence-based approaches include CBT, DBT, psychodynamic, and EMDR.

## How to Find an Online Therapist

**Online Platforms:** Talkspace and BetterHelp offer vetted therapists with flexible communication options ($260-400/month).

**Insurance Directory:** Many traditional therapists now offer telehealthâ€”check your insurance provider directory.

**Psychology Today:** Filter for online therapy providers in your area with detailed profiles.

## Questions to Ask

- What are your credentials and licenses?
- What's your experience with my specific concerns?
- What therapy approach do you use?
- What are your fees and insurance policies?
- How do you handle emergencies between sessions?
- Is your platform HIPAA-compliant?

## Red Flags to Avoid

Avoid therapists who aren't licensed in your state, promise quick fixes, push personal beliefs, violate boundaries, or make you feel consistently judged.

## Getting Started

1. Identify your needs
2. Research options (platforms vs. individual therapists)
3. Check insurance coverage
4. Schedule consultations with 2-3 therapists
5. Start trial period (give it 3-4 sessions)
6. Evaluate fit and switch if needed

## The Bottom Line

Choose a licensed therapist in your state who specializes in your concerns, uses an approach you're comfortable with, and makes you feel heard. Give it 3-4 sessions before deciding if it's the right fit.
