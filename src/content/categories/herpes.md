# Herpes Treatment & Outbreak Prevention

Genital herpes (HSV-2) and oral herpes/cold sores (HSV-1) affect millions of Americans. While there's no cure for herpes, modern antiviral medications can effectively manage outbreaks, reduce transmission risk, and suppress recurrent episodes. Telehealth platforms now offer discreet, convenient access to prescription herpes treatments without in-person visits.
