# Peptide Therapy & Research Peptides

Peptide therapy uses short chains of amino acids to target specific biological functions—from tissue repair to growth hormone optimization. Compare legitimate medical telehealth clinics offering prescription peptide therapy alongside research-grade peptide suppliers.

## Understanding Your Options

**Medical Telehealth Clinics** (Doctor-supervised, prescription peptides):
- Legal prescription path
- Medical supervision and monitoring
- Compound pharmacy sourcing
- Blood work and consultation included

**Research Peptide Suppliers** (Direct purchase, legal grey area):
- "For research purposes only"
- No prescription required
- Buyer assumes responsibility
- Lower cost, higher risk

## What We Cover

- **Growth Hormone Peptides**: CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, Ibutamoren (MK-677)
- **Healing Peptides**: BPC-157, TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4)
- **Fat Loss Peptides**: AOD-9604, Tesamorelin, MOTS-c
- **Performance Peptides**: Peptides for recovery, endurance, muscle growth
- **Longevity Peptides**: Epithalon, GHK-Cu, NAD+ enhancers

## Critical Legal & Safety Context

**FDA Status**: Most peptides are not FDA-approved for the uses discussed. Telehealth clinics can prescribe "off-label" through compounding pharmacies. Research suppliers operate in legal grey areas.

**Our Approach**: We compare ALL legitimate sources—medical clinics and research suppliers—with honest disclosure about legal status, safety, and supervision. Medical supervision is safer but more expensive. Research peptides are cheaper but you assume all risk.
