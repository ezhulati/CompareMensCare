## Overview

imaware is the first at-home blood testing platform to achieve peer-reviewed validation, with its methodology published in Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (CCLM), one of the world's leading clinical chemistry journals. Founded with a focus on scientific rigor over marketing hype, imaware offers 16 clinically-validated at-home tests processed in CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratories.

What sets imaware apart is its commitment to accuracy and transparency - sharing validation data with consumers and medical professionals, and earning the highest customer satisfaction rating (4.6/5) among major at-home testing companies. In 2023, imaware acquired binx health's consumer STI testing business, positioning itself as a leader in sexual health screening.
