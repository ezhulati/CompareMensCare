## Overview

Henry Meds is a telehealth platform specializing in affordable weight loss and hormone therapy, offering compounded GLP-1 medications (semaglutide and tirzepatide) at some of the lowest prices in the industry. Founded with a mission to make weight loss medications accessible without insurance, Henry Meds provides both injectable and oral formulations starting at just $149/month - significantly cheaper than competitors.

While Henry Meds excels at affordability and medication variety, the company has faced criticism for delivery delays, billing inconsistencies, and customer service issues. Despite a 4.0/5 rating from thousands of customers, the company holds an F rating on the Better Business Bureau (not accredited), primarily due to unresolved complaints about operational problems.

## Pricing (2025)

### Weight Loss (GLP-1 Medications)
**Compounded Semaglutide** (generic Ozempic/Wegovy):
- **Injectable**: $297/month ($247 first month)
- **Oral drops or tablets**: $249/month ($199 first month)

**Compounded Tirzepatide** (generic Mounjaro/Zepbound):
- **Injectable**: $349/month ($299 first month)
- **Oral dissolvable tablets**: $349/month ($299 first month)

### Testosterone Replacement Therapy
- **TRT**: $129/month ($79 first month)
- Compounded testosterone (injection or oral options)

**What's Included**:
- Telehealth provider consultations
- Medication cost
- Ongoing medical support
- 2-day shipping (after processing)
- No membership or subscription fees beyond medication cost

**Money-Back Guarantee**: 30-day, no-questions-asked refund policy

## How It Works

1. **Complete online assessment**: Medical intake questionnaire (15-20 minutes)
2. **Provider consultation**: Live video visit or asynchronous online assessment
3. **Get prescription**: If medically appropriate, provider prescribes GLP-1 medication
4. **Choose medication format**: Injectable or oral (tablets/drops)
5. **Receive medication**: 3-4 business days processing + 2-day shipping (8-10 days total)
6. **Ongoing support**: Regular check-ins with medical team

⚠️ **Important**: Delivery times often exceed estimates - delays are the #1 customer complaint.

## Medication Options

### Semaglutide (Same active ingredient as Ozempic/Wegovy)

**Injectable**:
- Self-administered once weekly with small needle
- Doses escalate gradually: 0.25mg → 0.5mg → 1mg → 2.4mg
- $297/month

**Oral (tablets or drops)**:
- Daily administration - no needles
- Up to 360mg compounded tablets per 60-day supply
- $249/month

### Tirzepatide (Same active ingredient as Mounjaro/Zepbound)

**Injectable**:

- $349/month

**Oral (dissolvable tablets)**:
- Daily 5mg or less tablets
- 60 tablets delivered every 60 days
- $349/month

### Important: Compounded vs Brand-Name

Henry Meds uses **compounded medications**, not FDA-approved brand drugs:

✅ **Advantages**:
- Significantly cheaper ($149-349 vs $1000+/month for brand Ozempic/Wegovy)
- Customizable dosing
- Available without insurance

⚠️ **Considerations**:
- Compounded drugs do not undergo FDA pre-market review or approval
- Mixed at 503(A) compounding pharmacies or 503(B) outsourcing facilities
- Patient-specific medications prescribed based on medical assessment
- Quality varies by compounding pharmacy

### How GLP-1 Medications Work

## Who It's Best For

✅ **Good fit if you**:
- Want the absolute lowest GLP-1 medication prices
- Prefer oral medication over injections
- Don't have insurance or insurance doesn't cover weight loss drugs
- Can tolerate potential delivery delays
- Have realistic expectations about customer service
- Meet BMI and health eligibility criteria

❌ **Not ideal if you**:
- Live in one of the 9 excluded states
- Need guaranteed on-time medication delivery
- Require responsive, reliable customer support
- Prefer FDA-approved brand-name medications
- Have urgent weight loss timeline

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 4.0/5** - Henry Meds offers the most affordable GLP-1 weight loss medications available, with unique oral options that eliminate needles. For budget-conscious men willing to navigate occasional operational hiccups, Henry Meds provides genuine access to effective weight loss treatment at a fraction of competitors' prices.

However, the F BBB rating and persistent delivery/billing complaints are real concerns. The company acknowledges these issues but hasn't fully resolved them, showing "blatant disregard for accountability" according to some critics.

**Best for**: Men prioritizing affordability over convenience, who can tolerate delivery delays and customer service inconsistencies in exchange for saving hundreds of dollars monthly on GLP-1 medications.

**Not recommended for**: Those requiring reliable delivery timelines or responsive customer support. Consider Hims, Ro, or LifeMD if operational excellence matters more than lowest price.

**Key Differentiator**: Industry-leading low prices ($149-349/month) for compounded GLP-1 medications with both oral and injectable formats - making effective weight loss treatment accessible without insurance.

**Important Note**: As of April 2025, FDA may restrict compounded semaglutide availability due to brand-name supply recovery. Verify current availability when ordering.
