## Overview

Nurx is a privacy-first telehealth platform founded in 2015, originally focused on birth control but now offering comprehensive sexual health services including herpes treatment. Known for exceptional discretion, supportive care, and educational resources, Nurx has become a trusted name for people seeking confidential STI treatment and prevention.

## What Nurx Treats

### Herpes Treatment (HSV-1 & HSV-2)

**Episodic (Outbreak) Therapy:**
- **Valacyclovir** (generic Valtrex): $30-45 per treatment course
  - 500mg or 1000mg options
  - 3-10 day treatment protocols
  - Keep on hand for outbreak management
- **Acyclovir**: $25-40 per treatment
  - Alternative if valacyclovir not suitable
  - More frequent dosing schedule

**Suppressive (Daily) Therapy:**
- **Valacyclovir daily**: $30/month
  - 500mg once daily (standard dose)
  - Reduces outbreak frequency by 70-80%
  - Reduces transmission risk to partners by ~50%
  - **Best for**: 6+ outbreaks per year or active relationship
- **Acyclovir daily**: $25/month
  - Twice-daily dosing
  - Slightly less convenient than valacyclovir

### Cold Sore Treatment (Oral Herpes - HSV-1)
- Same medications as genital herpes
- Episodic treatment for lip/mouth outbreaks
- Suppressive therapy if frequent cold sores

### PrEP (HIV Prevention)
- Truvada or generic emtricitabine/tenofovir
- Daily medication to prevent HIV
- Required lab testing every 3 months
