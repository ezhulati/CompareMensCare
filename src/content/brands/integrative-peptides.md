## Overview

Integrative Peptides focuses on **peptide supplements** (oral/capsule forms) rather than injectable research peptides. This positions them as wellness/supplement company vs. research chemical supplierâ€”different market, different legal status, different efficacy profile.

**Key Distinction**: Supplement-grade oral peptides, not injectable therapeutic peptides. Lower potency, different applications, less legal ambiguity.

## Product Focus

**Peptide Supplements (Oral/Capsule)**:
- Collagen peptides for skin/joints
- Bioactive peptide complexes
- Wellness formulations
- Integrative health blends

**Pricing**: $35-120 per product

**Not Offered**: Injectable BPC-157, TB-500, CJC/Ipamorelin (the therapeutic peptides most users seek)

## Oral vs. Injectable Peptides

### Bioavailability Problem
Injectable peptides: Near 100% bioavailability
Oral peptides: 5-20% bioavailability (most degraded by digestive enzymes)

**Therapeutic peptides (BPC-157, TB-500, CJC/Ipamorelin)**: Designed for injection. Oral forms have questionable efficacy.

**Collagen peptides**: Oral bioavailability is reasonable (different peptide structure).

### Who This Works For
- Users wanting collagen supplementation (skin, joints)
- Those avoiding injections entirely
- Wellness-focused (not therapeutic peptide users)
- People uncomfortable with research chemical legal status

### Who This Doesn't Work For
- Users seeking BPC-157 for injury healing (need injectable)
- CJC/Ipamorelin for GH optimization (must be injected)
- Therapeutic peptide applications (oral forms ineffective)

## Legal Status

**Less Legal Ambiguity**: Sold as dietary supplements, not "research chemicals." More legitimate regulatory status than injectable research peptides.

**Trade-off**: Lower therapeutic potency due to oral delivery limitations.

## Integrative Peptides vs. Injectable Research Suppliers

| Factor | Integrative Peptides | Ascension Peptides |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Format | Oral supplements | Injectable research |
| Bioavailability | 5-20% | ~100% |
| Legal Status | Supplements | Research (grey area) |
| Applications | Wellness, collagen | Therapeutic healing |
| Price | $35-120 | $30-150 |
| Ease of Use | Easy (oral) | Requires injection |

## Who Should Choose Integrative Peptides

**Good for**:
- Collagen peptide supplementation (skin, hair, joints)
- Users avoiding all injections
- Wellness/preventive approach (not therapeutic)
- Those wanting clearest legal status

**Not suitable for**:
- Injury healing (BPC-157 injectable needed)
- GH optimization (CJC/Ipamorelin must be injected)
- Therapeutic peptide applications
- Users wanting maximum efficacy

## Bottom Line

Integrative Peptides serves the **peptide supplement** market (oral collagen, wellness blends), not the **therapeutic peptide** market (injectable BPC-157, CJC/Ipamorelin).

Different product category entirely. If you want collagen supplements, this works. If you want BPC-157 for tendon healing or CJC/Ipamorelin for GH, you need injectable forms from research suppliers or medical clinics.

**Choose Integrative Peptides if**: You want oral collagen/peptide supplements for wellness. Avoid injections entirely.

**Choose research suppliers if**: You need therapeutic injectable peptides (BPC-157, TB-500, CJC/Ipamorelin).

**Choose medical clinic if**: You want therapeutic peptides with medical supervision and maximum safety.
