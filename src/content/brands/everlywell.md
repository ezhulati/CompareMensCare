Everlywell is the market-leading at-home health testing company, offering 30+ CLIA-certified lab tests that you can take from the comfort of your home. Founded in 2015, Everlywell has processed millions of tests, making preventive health screening accessible and affordable without requiring a doctor's visit.

Unlike telehealth consultation services, Everlywell provides actual lab testing kits shipped to your door. You collect a small blood, saliva, or urine sample at home, mail it to their certified labs using prepaid shipping, and receive physician-reviewed results digitally within days.

- Home collection technique affects accuracy - improper sampling can skew results
- Cannot replace doctor-ordered diagnostic testing for serious conditions

With 30+ test options, CLIA-certified labs, and HSA/FSA eligibility, it's ideal for preventive health monitoring and discreet STD testing.
