## Overview

Ascension Peptides is a direct-to-consumer research peptide supplier operating in the legal grey area of "research chemicals." The company sells peptides labeled "for research purposes only, not for human consumption"—a legal disclaimer that allows distribution without FDA approval.

**Critical Context**: This is NOT a medical clinic. No physician supervision, no blood work, no safety screening. Buyers assume full responsibility for use, dosing, and any health consequences.

## Legal & Safety Disclaimer

### Legal Status
Research peptides occupy a **legal grey area**:
- Not FDA-approved for human use
- Sold as "research chemicals" with "not for human consumption" labels
- Legal to purchase in most states
- **Buyer assumes all legal and health risks**

### What This Means
You're buying research-grade peptides without:
- Medical consultation
- Blood work screening
- Candidacy evaluation
- Dosing guidance from physician
- Safety monitoring
- Legal prescription protection

**This approach is higher risk than medical clinics.** Only proceed if you:
- Understand peptide pharmacology
- Can interpret blood work independently
- Accept legal ambiguity
- Prioritize cost over medical oversight

## What Ascension Peptides Sells

### Healing & Recovery
- **BPC-157** (5mg vials): $40-60
- **TB-500** (5mg vials): $50-80
- **GHK-Cu** (50mg): $35-50

### Growth Hormone Peptides
- **CJC-1295/Ipamorelin Blend** (10mg): $60-90
- **Ibutamoren (MK-677)** capsules: $50-70
- **Hexarelin** (5mg): $45-65

### Performance & Fat Loss
- **IGF-1 LR3** (1mg): $80-120
- **AOD-9604** (2mg): $40-60
- **MOTS-c** (5mg): $55-75

### Longevity & Anti-Aging
- **Epithalon** (10mg): $40-60
- **NAD+** (500mg): $35-50

## Pricing Breakdown

**Per Vial Costs** (significantly cheaper than medical clinics):
- BPC-157 5mg: $45 (vs $200-300/month from clinic)
- CJC/Ipamorelin 10mg: $75 (vs $250-350/month from clinic)
- TB-500 5mg: $65 (vs $300-400/month from clinic)

**Bulk Discounts**:
- 3 vials: 10% off
- 5+ vials: 15% off
- 10+ vials: 20% off

**Additional Costs**:
- Bacteriostatic water: $15-20
- Syringes (100-pack): $10-15
- **Blood work (your responsibility)**: $100-300 per panel

**Total First Month** (self-managed):
- Peptides: $45-150
- Supplies: $25-35
- Blood work (recommended): $100-300
- **Total**: $170-485 (still cheaper than medical clinic)

## Quality & Testing

### Third-Party Testing
Ascension provides certificates of analysis (COA) showing:
- Peptide purity (typically 98-99%)
- Heavy metal screening
- Bacterial contamination testing

### Quality Concerns
- COAs verify peptide content, not sterility
- Reconstitution at home risks contamination
- No pharmaceutical-grade manufacturing oversight
- Quality can vary between batches

### User Due Diligence
Check every batch's COA before injecting. Look for:
- Purity >98%
- Recent testing date (within 6 months)
- Clear lab identification

## How to Use Responsibly (If You Proceed)

### Step 1: Research Extensively
- Understand peptide mechanism, dosing, side effects
- Study half-life, reconstitution, injection technique
- Read clinical research, not just forum posts

### Step 2: Get Blood Work First
Order baseline panels:
- Complete metabolic panel (liver, kidney function)
- Hormone panel (if using GH peptides)
- Glucose/insulin (if using IGF-1 or MK-677)

### Step 3: Start Conservative
- Use lowest effective dose
- Monitor for side effects
- Track response in journal

### Step 4: Follow-Up Blood Work
Repeat panels after 8-12 weeks to monitor safety:
- Liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
- Kidney function (creatinine)
- Glucose/HbA1c (for GH peptides)

### Step 5: Stop If Problems Emerge
Abnormal blood work, persistent side effects, or unexpected reactions = stop immediately and consult physician.

## Ascension vs. Medical Clinics

| Factor | Ascension Peptides | TeleWellnessMD |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Cost | $45-150/month | $250-600/month |
| Medical Supervision | None | Physician oversight |
| Blood Work | Your responsibility | Included & monitored |
| Legal Status | Grey area | Prescription legal |
| Candidacy Screening | None | Physician evaluation |
| Risk Level | Higher | Lower |
| Best For | Experienced users, budget | First-timers, safety-focused |

## Who Should Use Ascension

### Good Fit:
- Experienced peptide users who understand protocols
- People who can interpret blood work independently
- Budget-conscious users willing to accept higher risk
- Those comfortable with legal grey area
- Users with clean health history (no contraindications)

### Poor Fit:
- First-time peptide users (get medical supervision)
- Anyone with health conditions requiring monitoring
- People uncomfortable with legal ambiguity
- Those who want safety screening and oversight
- Users who can afford medical clinic option

## Common User Mistakes

1. **Skipping blood work**: Peptides affect hormones and organs. You need baseline and follow-up labs.

2. **Trusting forum dosing**: Anecdotal reports aren't medical guidance. Start lower than "recommended" doses.

3. **Poor reconstitution technique**: Contamination risk. Use sterile water, alcohol wipes, proper injection technique.

4. **Ignoring side effects**: Blood sugar changes, water retention, joint pain—these signal problems. Don't power through.

5. **Stacking multiple peptides**: Start with one peptide. Adding multiple compounds makes problem-solving impossible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is buying research peptides legal?**
Grey area. Legal to purchase in most states, but peptides are labeled "not for human consumption." Using them is at your own risk.

**How do I know these are safe?**
You don't without medical supervision. COAs verify purity, not safety for human use. Research peptides lack pharmaceutical oversight.

**Can I get in trouble for ordering these?**
Unlikely for personal use quantities. Legal risk is low but exists. Medical risk (from unsupervised use) is higher concern.

**Do I need a prescription?**
No. Research peptides don't require prescriptions (another indicator of legal grey area).

**What if something goes wrong?**
You're on your own. No medical support, no liability protection. ER visits for peptide complications are awkward legal situations.

## Bottom Line

Ascension Peptides offers significantly cheaper access to peptides than medical clinics—$45-150/month vs $250-600/month. Trade-off: zero medical supervision, legal grey area, and you assume all risk.

**Choose Ascension if**: You're experienced, understand peptide pharmacology, can manage blood work independently, and prioritize cost over medical oversight.

**Choose medical clinic if**: You're new to peptides, have health conditions, want safety screening, or prefer legitimate prescription path.

**Honest assessment**: Research peptides work, but unsupervised use carries real risks. Abnormal blood work, contamination, dosing errors—these happen. Medical supervision costs more but catches problems before they become serious.

If budget forces the choice, use research peptides cautiously with strict blood work monitoring. If you can afford medical supervision, the safety is worth the premium.
