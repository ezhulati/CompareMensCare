## Overview

Particle Peptides is an EU-based research peptide supplier focusing on European markets with international shipping. They offer European-manufactured peptides as an alternative to US/China-sourced suppliers.

**Legal Status**: Research chemicals "for research purposes only." EU regulations differ from US. No medical supervision. Buyer assumes all risks.

## EU-Based Advantages

**European Pharmaceutical Standards**: EU manufacturing oversight differs from China/US suppliers. Some users prefer European sourcing for perceived quality control.

**For European Customers**: Domestic shipping within EU, no international customs, faster delivery.

**For US Customers**: Alternative source if US suppliers have stock issues. Trade-off: Longer shipping, customs clearance, higher shipping costs.

## Product Selection & Pricing

**Research Peptides** (prices in EUR, converted to USD):
- BPC-157 (5mg): €40-60 ($44-66)
- TB-500 (5mg): €55-75 ($60-83)
- CJC/Ipamorelin (10mg): €70-100 ($77-110)
- IGF-1 LR3 (1mg): €100-130 ($110-143)

**Shipping to US**: €15-30 ($17-33) depending on weight
**Delivery Time to US**: 10-21 days (customs clearance)

## Payment & Ordering

**Payment Methods**: Bank transfer only (no credit card or PayPal)
**Currency**: Prices listed in EUR, automatic conversion for international orders
**Order Processing**: 1-2 business days before shipment

**International Payment Considerations**:
- Bank transfer fees may apply ($15-45 depending on bank)
- Currency exchange rates affect final USD cost
- No PayPal or easy payment options

For US customers, payment process is less convenient than US suppliers accepting standard payment methods.

## Particle Peptides vs. US Research Suppliers

| Factor | Particle Peptides | Ascension Peptides |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Location | EU-based | US-based |
| Shipping to US | 10-21 days, customs | 3-7 days domestic |
| Affiliate Payment | EUR bank transfer | USD standard methods |
| Price (USD) | $44-155 + shipping | $30-150 |
| Best For | EU customers | US customers |

## Who Should Choose Particle Peptides

**EU/UK Customers**:
- Domestic EU shipping (fast, no customs)
- European pharmaceutical standards preference
- EUR payments convenient

**US Customers - Limited Cases**:
- US supplier stock shortages
- Preference for EU-sourced peptides
- Willing to accept longer shipping and higher costs

**Not Ideal For**:
- US users with access to domestic suppliers (faster, cheaper)
- Affiliates wanting easy payment methods (bank transfer hassle)
- Those needing fast delivery (international shipping slow)

## International Shipping Considerations

**Customs Clearance**: Peptides may be flagged at customs. EU-US shipments sometimes delayed for inspection. "Research chemicals" label can raise questions.

**Shipping Costs**: International shipping €15-30 ($17-33) vs $5-10 domestic US.

**Total Cost for US Buyers**:
- Peptide: $44-155
- Shipping: $17-33
- Potential customs fees: $0-50
- **Total**: Often more expensive than US suppliers

## Bottom Line

Particle Peptides serves **EU/UK customers** primarily. European pharmaceutical standards and domestic EU shipping are advantages for that market.

For **US customers**: Only makes sense if US suppliers have stock issues or you specifically want EU-sourced peptides. Longer shipping, higher costs, customs risks, and EUR bank transfer payments make US suppliers more practical.

**Choose Particle if**: You're in EU/UK and want domestic European source. Pharmaceutical standards matter to you.

**Choose US suppliers if**: You're in US and prioritize speed, cost, and payment convenience.
