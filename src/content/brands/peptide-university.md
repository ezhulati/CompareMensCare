## Overview

Peptide University is an **education platform**, not a peptide supplier. They offer training courses, certification programs, and protocol education for healthcare practitioners and advanced users interested in peptide therapy knowledge.

**What They Sell**: Courses, training, education, certification
**What They Don't Sell**: Peptides, medications, prescriptions

**Target Audience**: Physicians, NPs, PAs expanding into peptide therapy; biohackers wanting comprehensive education; wellness practitioners adding peptide protocols.

## Course Offerings

### Practitioner Programs

**Peptide Therapy Certification** ($697-997):
- Comprehensive peptide pharmacology
- Clinical protocols for common peptides
- Patient screening and monitoring
- Compounding pharmacy relationships
- Telehealth peptide practice setup

**Continuing Education Credits**: Some courses offer CE credits for licensed practitioners.

### Consumer/Biohacker Courses

**Peptide Fundamentals** ($97-197):
- Introduction to therapeutic peptides
- BPC-157, TB-500, CJC/Ipamorelin basics
- Dosing, reconstitution, injection technique
- Safety and blood work monitoring

**Advanced Protocols** ($297-497):
- Peptide stacking strategies
- Performance optimization protocols
- Anti-aging and longevity applications
- Troubleshooting and side effect management

### Protocol Templates & Resources

**Clinical Templates** ($197-397):
- Patient intake forms
- Consent documentation
- Monitoring protocols
- Dosing calculators

## Who Should Take These Courses

### Excellent For:

**Healthcare Practitioners**:
- Physicians/NPs/PAs starting peptide practice
- Functional medicine doctors expanding services
- Need structured training + protocols
- Want CE credits

**Serious Biohackers**:
- Want comprehensive peptide education
- Planning long-term self-managed protocols
- Willing to invest in knowledge vs. trial-and-error
- Value structured learning

### Not Suitable For:

**Casual Users**: $97-997 is expensive for basic peptide information available free online.

**Those Needing Medical Supervision**: Courses don't replace physician oversight. Education â‰  medical safety monitoring.

**People Wanting to Buy Peptides**: Wrong place. This is education, not product sales.

## Education vs. Medical Supervision

### What Courses Provide:
- Knowledge and protocol frameworks
- Dosing guidelines and monitoring templates
- Understanding of peptide pharmacology
- Risk awareness and safety protocols

### What Courses Don't Provide:
- Individualized medical advice
- Blood work interpretation for your case
- Legal prescription path
- Candidacy screening
- Ongoing medical monitoring

**Critical Distinction**: Even with education, self-managing peptides carries risks. Knowledge helps but doesn't replace medical oversight.

## Course Quality & Value

**Digital Learning Platform**: Comprehensive online courses with lifetime access, video tutorials, downloadable templates, and updated protocols.

**Student Support**: Direct instructor access via course forums, Q&A sessions, and ongoing updates as peptide research evolves.

**Best Student Profiles**:
- Practitioners interested in adding peptide services
- Biohacker/optimization communities
- Functional medicine practitioners
- Continuing education seekers

## Peptide University vs. Other Options

| Option | Peptide University | Medical Clinic | Research Supplier |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| What You Get | Education/courses | Treatment + supervision | Peptides only |
| Cost | $97-997 (one-time) | $250-600/month ongoing | $30-150/month |
| Medical Oversight | None | Physician oversight | None |
| Best For | Learning/practitioners | Treatment + safety | Experienced DIY |

## Value Proposition Analysis

**$97-197 Intro Courses**: Reasonable for comprehensive structured education if you're serious about peptides. Cheaper than medical consultations and more thorough than free blog posts.

**$297-997 Advanced/Certification**: Expensive for consumers. Makes sense for practitioners who will generate revenue from peptide services.

**ROI for Practitioners**: $997 certification course pays for itself with 2-4 peptide patients at $250-500/month revenue.

**ROI for Consumers**: Questionable unless you're committed to long-term self-managed protocols and value structured learning highly.

## Free Alternatives vs. Paid Courses

**Free Information Available**:
- Reddit forums (r/Peptides)
- Research papers
- YouTube tutorials
- Supplier education pages

**What Courses Add**:
- Structured curriculum (vs. scattered information)
- Clinical protocols and templates
- Practitioner perspectives
- Certification credentials (for practitioners)
- CE credits (for licensed professionals)

**Worth Paying For?**: Depends on your goals. Practitioners benefit from credentials and structure. Serious biohackers may value comprehensive protocols. Casual users can learn for free.

## Bottom Line

Peptide University serves the **peptide education market**, not the peptide product market. Valuable for practitioners building peptide practices and serious biohackers wanting structured knowledge. Expensive for casual users.

**Choose Peptide University if**:
- You're a practitioner adding peptide services (certification valuable)
- You want comprehensive structured peptide education
- You're committed to long-term self-managed protocols
- You value templates and clinical frameworks

**Skip it if**:
- You just want to try BPC-157 once (too expensive for casual use)
- You prefer medical supervision (courses don't replace doctors)
- Free information is sufficient for your needs
- You're buying peptides, not education

**Best for**: Healthcare practitioners expanding into peptide therapy, serious biohackers wanting comprehensive education, not casual peptide users.
