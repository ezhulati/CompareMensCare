## Quick Verdict

**Cerebral:** Full-service mental health platform with therapy, psychiatry, and medication management. Insurance-accepted with copays as low as $30/month. Best for users needing medications alongside therapy ($99-325/month, or $30-60 with insurance).

**BetterHelp:** Therapy-only platform with weekly live sessions and unlimited messaging. No insurance but straightforward out-of-pocket pricing. Best for therapy-focused care without medication needs ($260-400/month).

**Bottom Line:** Choose Cerebral if you need or might need medication (antidepressants, anti-anxiety, ADHD meds) or have insurance. Choose BetterHelp for therapy-only care with longer sessions.

## Detailed Comparison

### Medication Management - Cerebral's Biggest Advantage

**Cerebral** offers full psychiatric medication management:
- Prescribers evaluate you for medication needs
- Can prescribe antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs)
- Anti-anxiety medications (buspirone, hydroxyzine)
- ADHD medications (stimulants, non-stimulants)
- Sleep medications
- Monthly medication management visits ($30-60 with insurance)
- Medications mailed directly to you
- Ongoing monitoring and dose adjustments

**BetterHelp** does not offer medication services:
- Therapists cannot prescribe medications
- Must see separate psychiatrist/PCP for medications
- Focus solely on talk therapy
- Refer out for medication needs

If you need medication for depression, anxiety, or ADHD, Cerebral is the only option between these two.

### Insurance Coverage

**Cerebral** accepts many insurance plans:
- Aetna, Cigna, Anthem, United, and others
- Typical copays: $30-60 per therapy session
- Medication management copays: $30-60/month
- Prescriptions billed through your pharmacy benefit
- Significantly reduces out-of-pocket costs if covered
- Check Cerebral website for your specific plan

**BetterHelp** does not accept insurance:
- All out-of-pocket payment
- Can request receipts for insurance superbill submission
- FSA/HSA cards accepted
- Most insurance won't reimburse online therapy
- Predictable monthly cost but no coverage help

### Pricing Comparison

**Cerebral** with insurance: $30-60/session copay

**BetterHelp:** $260-400/month ($65-100/week)

### Therapy Quality & Session Structure

**Cerebral:**
- 30-minute weekly live video sessions
- Unlimited messaging between sessions

- Care team approach (therapist + prescriber)

**BetterHelp:**
