## Detailed Comparison

### Testing & Diagnosis

**Hone Health** uses comprehensive at-home hormone testing:
- At-home finger-prick blood test kit ($45, often waived)
- Tests total testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, SHBG, LH, FSH
- Results in 2-3 days
- 45-60 minute physician consultation to review

**Hims** requires traditional lab testing:
- Partner with Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp
- In-person lab visit ($50-75 out-of-pocket)
- Tests total testosterone primarily
- Online questionnaire + brief physician review
- Faster approval (often same-day after results)
- Follow-up testing as needed ($50+ per test)

Hone's at-home testing is more convenient and comprehensive. Hims is faster to start but requires lab visit.

### Pricing Comparison

- Testosterone injections: $139-179/month
- Testosterone cream: $179/month
- Includes quarterly hormone testing ($180 value)

## Common Questions

**Is Hone Health worth the extra cost?**

For many users, yes. Hone includes quarterly testing ($180 annual value), specialist physician consultations (vs general MDs), and comprehensive hormone optimization. If you factor in the cost of testing Hims charges extra for ($200-300/year), Hone's premium shrinks to $40-60/month. You're paying for TRT specialist care, better monitoring, and hormone optimization beyond just testosterone. If you want the cheapest possible TRT, choose Hims. If you want optimal results and long-term health, Hone is worth it.

**Can I get the same testosterone medication from both?**

Yes, both prescribe FDA-approved testosterone cypionate for injections and testosterone cream/gel. The medication is identical - 200mg/mL testosterone cypionate from licensed U.S. pharmacies. The difference is medical oversight, monitoring, and customization, not the drug itself. You'll achieve similar testosterone levels on either platform if dosed appropriately.

**Which is better for first-time TRT users?**

Hone Health is better for TRT beginners because specialist physicians explain the process thoroughly, monitor more markers (estrogen, SHBG), and catch/prevent side effects early. The 45-60 minute initial consultation educates you properly. Hims works for experienced TRT users who know what to expect and just need affordable medication access. Starting TRT is complex - specialist guidance helps avoid common mistakes.

**Do I need quarterly testing if I'm on stable TRT?**

Yes, quarterly testing (every 3 months) is medical best practice for TRT, especially the first year. You need to monitor testosterone levels, estrogen, hematocrit (blood thickness), PSA (prostate), and liver function. Annual testing minimum, quarterly is ideal. Hone includes this; Hims requires you to order separately. Long-term TRT without proper monitoring risks cardiovascular issues, prostate problems, and hormone imbalances.

**Can I switch from Hims to Hone (or vice versa)?**

Yes, easily. Both allow cancellation anytime. Bring your current prescription and recent lab results to your new provider consultation. Many users start with Hone for the specialist onboarding and monitoring, then switch to Hims once stable to save money. Or start with Hims for fast, cheap TRT, then switch to Hone if you need better optimization or monitoring.

**Which has better customer service?**

Hone Health has more responsive, medically-focused support because they're TRT-only. Hims has larger support team handling multiple services, which can mean longer response times but more comprehensive FAQ resources. For medical questions, Hone's direct physician access is superior. For billing/logistics questions, both are adequate.
