## Quick Verdict

**Ro:** Premium medical care with ongoing physician access, flexible dosing options, and polished platform experience. Best for users wanting comprehensive care, custom treatment plans, and ongoing MD support ($49-100/month).

**Hims:** Fast, streamlined ED treatment with 2-3 day shipping, user-friendly platform, and competitive pricing. Best for users prioritizing speed, convenience, and value over customization ($44-95/month).

**Bottom Line:** Choose Ro if you value ongoing physician relationships and flexible dosing. Choose Hims if you want the fastest service at the best price with minimal friction.

## Detailed Comparison

### Price Comparison

**Hims** has a slight edge on starting price at $44/month vs Ro's $49/month for generic ED medications. However, both services are in the same price range for comparable treatments. Generic sildenafil runs $44-85/month at Hims vs $49-95/month at Ro. Tadalafil is similar: $44-95/month at Hims vs $49-100/month at Ro.

Both also offer brand-name Viagra and Cialis at premium pricing ($140-200/month range). The price difference is minimal - your choice should be based on other factors like physician access and platform experience.

### Medical Care & Support

**Ro** emphasizes ongoing physician relationships. After your initial consultation, you have continued access to your physician for questions, dose adjustments, or concerns. This makes Ro feel more like a traditional doctor's office with the convenience of telemedicine.

**Hims** provides medical consultations as needed but focuses more on the streamlined subscription experience. You can reach out to providers when you need them, but the model is less focused on ongoing physician relationships and more on convenient medication delivery.

### Treatment Customization

**Ro** excels at customization. They offer more dosing options, flexible regimens, and will work with you to find the exact right treatment. If you need a specific dose or want to combine treatments, Ro's physicians are more likely to accommodate custom requests.

**Hims** offers standard dosing options that cover most users' needs. While they have multiple options, the focus is on proven, straightforward treatment plans rather than highly customized regimens.

### Platform & Experience

**Ro** has a more premium, polished feel. Their website, mobile experience, and communication feel more like working with a traditional high-end medical practice. The experience emphasizes quality, professionalism, and thoroughness.

**Hims** optimizes for simplicity and speed. Their platform is designed to get you from consultation to medication as quickly as possible. It's more casual, more consumer-friendly, and faster - but perhaps less "medical" in tone.

### Shipping & Logistics

**Hims** ships faster (2-3 days vs 3-5 days). Both offer discreet packaging, automatic refills, and easy subscription management. Both let you cancel or pause anytime.

### Our Recommendation

Choose **Ro** if you value ongoing physician relationships, want highly customized treatment, or prefer a premium medical experience. Ro is ideal for users who appreciate thoroughness, want flexible dosing, or have specific medical needs requiring physician consultation.

Choose **Hims** if you want the fastest, most streamlined experience at a competitive price. Hims is perfect for users who know what they need, want minimal friction, and value speed over customization. Their 2-3 day shipping is hard to beat.

## Common Questions

**Is Ro worth the higher price?**

Ro's pricing is only slightly higher ($5-10/month difference for most treatments). The value comes from ongoing physician access and more customization options. If you value having a doctor available for questions or need flexible dosing, Ro is worth it. If you just want standard ED treatment delivered fast, Hims offers better value.

**Do they use the same medications?**

Yes, both offer the same FDA-approved medications: generic sildenafil (Viagra), generic tadalafil (Cialis), and brand-name options. They source from licensed U.S. pharmacies. The medications are identical - the difference is in service, customization, and platform experience, not the drugs themselves.

**Which has better privacy?**

Both offer excellent privacy. Discreet unmarked packaging, confidential online consultations, and private billing. Neither service's name appears on your credit card statement in an obvious way. Both are HIPAA-compliant. From a privacy standpoint, they're equivalent.

**Can I use both services for different health needs?**

Technically yes, but it's simpler to use one platform. Both Ro and Hims offer multiple health services (ED, hair loss, testosterone, weight loss, etc.). If you need treatment for multiple conditions, pick whichever platform you prefer and consolidate everything there. It's easier to manage and potentially cheaper with bundled treatments.
