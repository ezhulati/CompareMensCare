**LetsGetChecked** uses single CLIA-certified partner lab with standardized protocols. Clinical-grade equipment and validation processes. Same accuracy as traditional lab testing.

Independent studies show at-home finger-prick tests for testosterone, thyroid, and other markers are 95-99% as accurate as venipuncture when done correctly.

### Sample Collection & Process

**Everlywell:**
- Finger-prick blood samples (most tests)
- Urine samples (some tests)
- Saliva samples (cortisol, COVID)

- Finger-prick blood samples (most tests)
- Urine samples (STD tests)
- Detailed written + video instructions
- Customer support available for collection questions
- Prepaid shipping label
- Kit activation required

Both are equally easy to use. Success rates over 95% for proper sample collection when instructions followed.

### Treatment & Follow-Up

**Everlywell** is testing-only:
- Provides results and educational materials
- Suggests seeing your doctor if abnormal
- Does not prescribe medications
- Does not provide ongoing medical care
- Best for monitoring known conditions or screening

**LetsGetChecked** offers integrated care:
- Physician team reviews all results
- Free consultation to discuss abnormal findings
- Can prescribe treatments when appropriate (e.g., testosterone for low T)

- End-to-end health management

This is LetsGetChecked's major advantage - if you test low testosterone, they can prescribe TRT. If you have high cholesterol, they'll discuss treatment. Everlywell just gives you results to take elsewhere.

## Common Questions

**Are at-home tests as accurate as lab tests?**

Yes, when done correctly. Both Everlywell and LetsGetChecked use CLIA-certified labs meeting the same federal standards as hospital labs. Finger-prick blood samples for testosterone, thyroid, cholesterol, etc. are 95-99% as accurate as traditional venipuncture. The testing equipment and methods are identical - only the collection method differs. Thousands of validation studies confirm at-home test accuracy.

**Which is better for testosterone testing?**

Everlywell is cheaper ($49 vs $69) if you just want your testosterone levels to discuss with a doctor or TRT provider. LetsGetChecked is better if you might want TRT prescription based on results - they include physician consultation and can prescribe if you're a candidate. For pure data collection, choose Everlywell. For testing + potential treatment, choose LetsGetChecked.

**Do these tests replace going to the doctor?**

No, they're complementary tools. Both services recommend sharing results with your physician. Everlywell is purely informational - you take results to your doctor for interpretation and treatment. LetsGetChecked provides physician oversight and can prescribe some treatments, but you should still have a primary care doctor for comprehensive care. Use these for convenient screening and monitoring, not complete medical care.

**Will my insurance cover these tests?**

No, neither accepts insurance directly. However, both accept FSA/HSA cards for tax-advantaged payment. Some users successfully submit superbills for out-of-network reimbursement, but coverage varies widely. Most people pay out-of-pocket. At-home testing is generally cheaper than lab copays anyway ($49-99 vs $150-300 at LabCorp).

**How long do results take?**

Both deliver results in 2-5 business days after the lab receives your sample. Total timeline:
- Day 1: Order and receive kit (2-3 days shipping)
- Day 2: Complete test and mail back
- Day 3-4: Lab receives sample
- Day 5-9: Results delivered online

Everlywell sometimes faster (2-3 days) while LetsGetChecked averages 3-5 days because physician review takes time. Both are significantly faster than scheduling a doctor's appointment, going to a lab, and waiting for results (often 1-2 weeks total).

**Can I use these tests if I'm on TRT or other medication?**

Yes. Both platforms are excellent for monitoring testosterone levels while on TRT, thyroid levels on thyroid medication, cholesterol on statins, etc. Many users order regular tests (quarterly or semi-annually) to monitor treatment effectiveness. Subscription discounts make repeat testing more affordable on both platforms.
