**Ro** provides more comprehensive side effect support with coaching team offering dietary strategies, lifestyle modifications, and frequent check-ins to manage symptoms.

### Effectiveness & Results

- Average 20-25% body weight loss with tirzepatide
- Results depend on medication adherence, dose, and lifestyle factors

Ro's coaching and support tools may help some users maximize results through better adherence and lifestyle integration, but medication efficacy is the primary driver regardless of platform.

## Common Questions

**Why is Henry Meds so much cheaper?**

Henry Meds focuses exclusively on medication access with minimal overhead - no premium platform, limited coaching, basic customer service. They pass savings to customers. Ro invests in comprehensive platform, coaching team, faster shipping, and premium experience, which costs more. Both use compounded GLP-1s from FDA-registered pharmacies. The medication quality is comparable; you're paying more at Ro for additional services.

**Are compounded GLP-1s as effective as brand-name?**

Yes. Compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide contain the same active ingredients as Wegovy and Zepbound. They work identically at the molecular level. The difference is formulation and delivery device. Brand-name uses auto-injector pens; compounded uses standard injection pens. Both are FDA-regulated and clinically effective. Studies show compounded versions produce equivalent weight loss results.

**Will I lose the same amount of weight on both platforms?**

Weight loss depends primarily on the medication (semaglutide vs tirzepatide), dose, adherence, and lifestyle factors - not the platform. If you're disciplined with diet/exercise and medication adherence, you'll likely achieve similar results on either platform. Ro's coaching may help if you need accountability and support to stay on track. Self-motivated users do equally well on Henry Meds.

**Which has better medical oversight?**

Both require physician prescription and provide medical oversight. Ro offers more frequent check-ins and comprehensive health coaching. Henry Meds provides physician supervision focused on medication safety and efficacy. Both will adjust doses, manage side effects, and ensure medical appropriateness. If you need intensive support, choose Ro. If you're comfortable with standard medical care, Henry Meds is sufficient.

**Can I switch from Ro to Henry Meds to save money?**

Yes. If you're stable on your current dose and want to reduce costs, you can transfer care to Henry Meds. Bring your current dose information to your Henry Meds consultation. Many users start with Ro for the coaching support, then switch to Henry Meds once they're comfortable with the medication and routine. Both platforms allow you to cancel anytime.

**Does insurance cover either platform?**

Neither typically covered by insurance for weight loss (though Ro can prescribe brand-name Wegovy which some plans cover if you meet BMI criteria). HSA/FSA usually accepted on both platforms. If you have insurance coverage for Wegovy through Ro, that could change the cost calculus significantly - brand-name with insurance may be cheaper than compounded out-of-pocket.
