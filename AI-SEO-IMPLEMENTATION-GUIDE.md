<QuickSummary
  summary="Sildenafil and tadalafil are both effective ED treatments. Sildenafil works faster (30-60 min) but lasts shorter (4-6 hours). Tadalafil takes longer (1-2 hours) but lasts up to 36 hours."
  points={[
    "Both medications have similar effectiveness rates (60-70%)",

    "Hims offers the best value for basic ED and hair loss treatments, with prices 20-30% lower than competitors",
    "Ro provides the most flexibility with pay-per-dose options and ongoing physician support",
    "Both services are legitimate, use licensed physicians, and ship genuine medications",
    "Your choice should depend on whether you prioritize price (Hims) or flexibility (Ro)"
  ]}
/>
```

**Best Practices:**

  brand2Verdict="Flexible telehealth service with pay-per-dose options and personalized physician support."
  brand2BestFor="Flexibility and ongoing doctor relationship"
  bottomLine="Choose Hims if you want the lowest prices and multiple treatments in one place. Choose Ro if you prefer pay-as-you-go flexibility and more physician interaction."
/>
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep verdicts to 1-2 sentences each

/>

  sourcesReviewed={15}
  compact={true}
/>
```

- Use full version on pillar guides
- Use compact version on blog posts

**To Be Added To:**

- Major blog posts

---

### 6. FAQSection Component (`/src/components/FAQSection.astro`)

**Purpose:** Critical for AI citations - includes FAQ schema markup

**Usage:**
```astro
<FAQSection
  title="Common Questions About ED Treatment"
  categoryName="Erectile Dysfunction"
  faqs={[
    {
      question: "How long does sildenafil take to work?",
      answer: "Sildenafil typically takes 30-60 minutes to become effective. For best results, take it on an empty stomach 1 hour before sexual activity. Effects last 4-6 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "Is generic Viagra as effective as brand-name?",
      answer: "Yes. Generic sildenafil contains the same active ingredient as Viagra and is FDA-approved as bioequivalent, meaning it works identically. The main difference is price - generics cost 80-90% less."
    }
  ]}
/>
```

**Best Practices:**
