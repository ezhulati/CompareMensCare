Website Architecture and Content Plan for a Men’s Telehealth Comparison Site
Goals and Purpose

Objective guidance: Provide men with evidence‑based comparisons of telehealth services for conditions such as erectile dysfunction (ED), hair loss, low testosterone, weight management, mental‑health care and at‑home diagnostics. The site will normalize costs, highlight clinical fit and call out differences in services (e.g., compounded versus FDA‑approved medicines).

Affiliate monetization: Earn revenue through the 12 confirmed affiliate programs (Hims, Ro, BlueChew, Keeps, Manual, Numan, Hone Health, Vault Health, HealthyMale, BetterHelp, Talkspace and LetsGetChecked). Each program pays per sale or per lead and uses 30‑day cookies

.

Transparency and trust: Follow FTC disclosure rules and UK/ASA guidance. Publish rating methodology, update dates and medical reviewer credentials.

Page Types and Templates
1. Best‑of Category Pages

These are the pillar pages designed to capture search intent like “best ED telehealth services” or “best online hair‑loss treatments.” Each page should:

Introduce the condition with a short definition and a link to an educational guide.

Provide an interactive comparison table (sort/filter) listing the major providers in that category, with columns such as:

Service model (subscription vs per‑visit).

Medication types (FDA‑approved vs compounded).

Initial and ongoing costs (normalized to 30 days where relevant).

Consultation method (asynchronous questionnaire, live video, therapy session).

Availability (countries or U.S. states served).

Review score (based on your published rubric) and sample pros/cons.

Include “Check Price” buttons that use your central redirect to the affiliate program with proper disclosure labels.

Embed sidebars or call‑outs summarizing safety notes, insurance coverage options and coupon codes.

2. Brand Review Pages

For each provider (e.g., “Hims Review,” “Ro Review”):

Overview: Brief history, mission, and summary of services.

What They Treat: Summarize categories offered (e.g., Hims offers ED, hair loss, weight loss, testosterone and mental health
hims.com
; Ro covers sexual health, weight loss, fertility, hair and skin
ro.co
).

Pricing & Plans: Break down consultation fees, medication costs by dose, subscription options and any membership tiers. Normalize costs to monthly figures where possible.

Process & Access: Describe how customers begin (questionnaire, video consult, lab tests), time to provider, prescription process and refills.

Pros & Cons: Use bullet lists; draw on third‑party reviews and known issues (e.g., BlueChew is convenient but only available in the U.S.
medicalnewstoday.com
).

Comparison to Competitors: Link to relevant comparison pages.

Affiliate Disclosure: Place a disclosure statement near each affiliate link.

Update box: Note last review date and editor/medical reviewer names.

3. Comparison Pages

Pages like “Hims vs Ro for ED” or “Keeps vs Manual: Hair‑Loss Treatments” help capture comparative search queries. Structure these pages as follows:

Executive summary: Who each brand suits best.

Side‑by‑side tables: Compare pricing, treatments offered, service model, subscription terms, shipping, and user experience.

Detailed breakdown: Explore differences in consultation method, medication formulations, compounding vs FDA‑approved, and state coverage.

Verdict & recommendation: Summarize which customer profile benefits from each provider, with call‑to‑action buttons.

4. Educational Guides & Condition Pages

Develop thorough guides for each condition (ED, hair loss, low testosterone, obesity, anxiety, etc.). Each guide should:

Explain symptoms, causes and diagnosis.

Describe all mainstream treatment options (telehealth services, lifestyle changes, prescription drugs) with references to clinical guidelines.

Provide sections on risks, side effects and when to consult a doctor.

Link to relevant “Best‑of” and brand pages as possible solutions.

Include citations to credible sources (peer‑reviewed journals, FDA guidance, etc.).

5. Blog & News Posts

Maintain a blog for timely updates such as:

Regulatory changes (FTC endorsement rules, FDA warnings about compounded weight‑loss medications, Google Ads policies).

New clinical studies on treatments (e.g., efficacy of finasteride vs minoxidil for hair loss).

Interviews with healthcare providers or patient stories (with consent).

Seasonal topics (e.g., “Top resolutions for men’s health in January”).

Content Management System & Data Model

CMS Choice: Use a headless CMS like Sanity, Contentful or a Notion‑to‑static converter. They allow structured content and rich text editing.

Data model:

Brand: name, slug, company bio, categories offered, services (list), pricing data (visit fee, medication costs, subscription tiers), shipping policy, state/country coverage, regulatory notes, affiliate details (program, commission, cookie length).

Category: name, description, conditions addressed, slug, associated brands.

Comparison: pair of brand slugs, category, table fields, pros/cons, verdict, affiliate links.

Guide: title, category, content body, citations, last reviewed date.

Blog Post: title, slug, tags, publish date, content body, author, images.

Affiliate link handling: Store affiliate IDs and deep‑link patterns separately. Use a serverless redirect (e.g., /go/hims) to allow quick updates without changing content.

Version control: Track changes with Git. Use a changelog file and display “last updated” dates on pages.

Editorial & Publishing Plan

Month 1 (MVP Launch):

Publish four category hubs: Sexual Health (ED), Hair Health, Testosterone Therapy and Weight Loss.

Create 12 brand review pages covering the affiliate partners listed above.

Produce at least one “Best [Category] Services” article per hub with comparison tables.

Write one educational guide for each category (e.g., “Understanding Erectile Dysfunction,” “Causes of Hair Loss”).

Generate 6–8 comparison pages (e.g., Hims vs Ro for ED; Keeps vs Hims for hair loss).

Set up site‑wide disclosure and start collecting email sign‑ups with a simple newsletter form.

Month 2–3 (Expansion):

Add Mental Health and Diagnostics hubs. Publish “Best Online Therapy Platforms” comparing BetterHelp and Talkspace, and “Best At‑Home Test Kits” featuring LetsGetChecked.

Release new brand pages for BetterHelp, Talkspace and LetsGetChecked.

Publish additional guides (e.g., “How GLP‑1 medications work,” “How to prepare for a teletherapy session”).

Introduce tools such as a “Find Your Best Provider” quiz that filters options based on location, budget and concern.

Start a monthly “News Roundup” blog post summarizing regulatory updates and new studies.

Ongoing:

Update pricing tables and brand data monthly or whenever partners change pricing, cookie length or service coverage.

Refresh medical guides annually with new research. Note revision dates.

Post new blog articles weekly. Mix evergreen and timely topics.

Expand into additional categories (skin care, fertility, general wellness) as demand or new affiliate opportunities arise.

Collect user feedback via surveys to refine scoring criteria.

SEO & User Experience Considerations

Keyword targeting: Each page should target a specific primary keyword and several long‑tail keywords. Use terms like “best telehealth ED services,” “hims vs keeps comparison,” and “is minoxidil safe for hair loss.”

Structured data: Implement schema.org Product, MedicalOrganization, FAQPage and Review markup. This improves click‑through rates and eligibility for rich snippets.

Internal linking: Connect guide pages to brand reviews and comparison pages. Use breadcrumb navigation for easy backtracking.

Responsive design: Ensure tables and comparison widgets work well on mobile (tables should scroll horizontally or collapse into cards).

Accessibility: Use clear headings, alt text for images, and high‑contrast colours. Allow keyboard navigation of tables and quizzes.

Performance: Use image optimisation and static site generation to minimise load times. Prefetch data for interactive filters.

Monetization & Compliance

Affiliate disclosures: Place a conspicuous disclosure near the top of every page containing affiliate links. Use plain language (e.g., “We may earn a commission if you buy through links on our site”).

Regulatory compliance: Follow FTC endorsement guides, which require clear connection between content and compensation
theaffiliatemonkey.com
. For UK visitors, treat affiliate content as advertising and avoid promoting prescription‑only medicines to the public.

Medical disclaimer: State that the site does not provide medical advice and that readers should consult healthcare professionals.

Privacy: Avoid handling personally identifiable health information. If offering quizzes, keep data anonymised and secure.

Technical Stack & Tools

Frontend: Use Next.js or Astro with MDX support to allow server‑side rendering of dynamic tables and interactive filters.

CMS: Sanity (hosted) or an open‑source Notion‑to‑markdown pipeline for editorial ease. Connect to Git for version control.

Analytics: Google Analytics 4 or Plausible for privacy‑focused tracking. Implement conversion tracking for affiliate link clicks.

Hosting: Deploy to Vercel or Netlify. Use environment variables to manage affiliate IDs.

Search functionality: Implement client‑side search over guides and brand pages; provide auto‑suggestions.

Quizzes & Forms: Build interactive quizzes using React hooks; store results client‑side or send to your email service provider.

Enhancements and Future Opportunities

Price alert service: Allow users to sign up for notifications when providers change pricing or open in new states. This creates recurring traffic and email engagement.

Video content: Produce explainer videos summarizing each category or provider. Host on YouTube to capture additional search traffic and embed in articles.

User reviews: If legally permissible, collect and display anonymised user feedback for each provider to complement your expert rating.

Partnerships: Explore lead‑generation deals with local clinics for cases where telehealth is inappropriate or unavailable.

International expansion: Once the U.S. and UK content is established, research telehealth programs in Canada, Australia and the EU and add regional hubs.

Conclusion

Building a men’s telehealth comparison site requires a well‑structured information architecture, rigorous editorial process and regular updates. By creating dedicated hubs for sexual health, hair health, testosterone therapy, weight loss, mental health and diagnostics—and by populating each hub with comparison tables, brand reviews, educational guides and up‑to‑date blog posts—you can help users choose the best telehealth provider for their needs. This structure also aligns with the 12 affiliate programs identified earlier, providing clear pathways for monetization while maintaining trust and compliance with regulatory guidelines.
