## Testing Plan

### User Testing Scenarios

**Sleep Category**:
1. Test as burned-out professional → Should recommend RexMD or similar with non-addictive emphasis
2. Test as chronic insomniac with cost concerns → Should recommend most affordable option
3. Test as acute crisis needing privacy → Should recommend fastest, most discreet option

**Herpes Category**:
1. Test as recently diagnosed → Should recommend educational platforms (Ro)
2. Test as frequent outbreak sufferer → Should recommend affordable suppressive therapy
3. Test as relationship-concerned → Should recommend comprehensive platforms with consultation

**PE Category**:
1. Test as performance anxiety (situational) → Should recommend topical/on-demand options
2. Test as chronic PE sufferer → Should recommend SSRI daily treatment platforms
3. Test as optimizer → Should recommend platforms with multiple options

### Analytics to Track
- Which Q2 options are most selected per category
- Drop-off rates at each question
- Final brand selections vs expected matches
- User satisfaction with recommendations (if survey implemented)

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should we add a "Not sure / Both" option** to Q2 questions to allow for ambiguity?
2. **How do we handle users who don't fit neatly into personas?** (e.g., chronic insomniac who also needs privacy)
3. **Should we allow users to go back and change category mid-flow?**
4. **Do we need a "Learn more about my options" path** that doesn't immediately push to matching?

---

**Status**: Ready for review and implementation
**Next Steps**: Review personas and questions with user, then implement in GuidedMatcher.astro
