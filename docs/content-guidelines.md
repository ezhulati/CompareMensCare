# Content Guidelines: Human-Centered Transformation Writing

## Core Philosophy

**Nobody gives a shit about your product. Sell transformation, not information.**

These guidelines transform AI-optimized information dumps into human-centered transformation stories that speak to real people making real decisions.

## The Transformation Framework

Every piece of content follows this structure:

### 1. Problem (Hook)
- Start with the reader's actual problem in their language
- Use real quotes/scenarios from Reddit/forums
- Address the emotional state, not just the symptom
- Make it specific and relatable

**Bad**: "Erectile dysfunction affects millions of men."
**Good**: "You've been avoiding sex for three months. Every time your partner initiates, you make an excuse. The shame is eating you alive, and you're terrified she thinks it's about her."

### 2. Transformation (The Promise)
- What does their life look like after solving this?
- Be specific about timelines and realistic expectations
- Address the emotional outcome, not just the functional fix

**Bad**: "ED medications can improve sexual function."
**Good**: "In 8 weeks, you're initiating sex again. The anxiety is gone. You're not perfect—sometimes you still need the pill, sometimes you don't—but the shame? That's history."

### 3. Path (The Journey)
- Clear decision framework (not "it depends")
- Real timelines with what to expect week by week
- Honest about setbacks and how to handle them
- Actionable next steps

## Language Rules

### USE THIS LANGUAGE:
- "You're freaking out because..."
- "You're probably wondering..."
- "The good news / bad news..."
- "If you're like most guys..."
- "Worth it? Depends on..."
- Direct statements with data ("Sildenafil takes 60 minutes to peak")
- Questions that reflect user concerns ("Will this work for me?")

### NEVER USE THIS LANGUAGE:

**AI-Giveaway Phrases (Dead Giveaways of AI Writing):**
- "Actually" / "What Actually..." (e.g., "What Actually Happens", "What You'll Actually Pay")
- "Real talk" / "Real answer" / "The real truth"
- "Here's what..." / "Here's the thing" / "Here's the deal"
- "Let's be honest" / "To be honest" / "Let's be real"
- "Bottom line:" (use "Summary:" or direct statement instead)
- "Reality check:" / "The reality is"
- "The truth is" / "Truth:"
- "What really matters" / "What actually matters"
- "Just to be clear"
- "At the end of the day"

**Clinical/Academic Language:**
- "Studies show..."
- "Research indicates..."
- "It is important to note..."
- "May cause / might experience"
- "Consult your healthcare provider" (unless legally required)
- Clinical jargon without translation
- Passive voice
- Hedge words (perhaps, possibly, potentially)

### BETTER ALTERNATIVES:

Instead of AI-giveaway phrases, use:
- ❌ "What Actually Happens" → ✅ "What Happens" or "The Timeline"
- ❌ "Here's what you need to know" → ✅ Direct statement with data
- ❌ "Bottom line:" → ✅ "Summary:" or just state the conclusion
- ❌ "The truth is" → ✅ Just state the fact directly
- ❌ "Let's be honest" → ✅ Remove entirely, just be honest
- ❌ "What really matters" → ✅ "Key factors:" or "Most important:"
- ❌ "Actually works" → ✅ "works" (just remove "actually")
- ❌ "Real answer" → ✅ Direct answer without qualifier

**Examples:**
- Bad: "Here's what actually happens when you take sildenafil..."
- Good: "Sildenafil takes 60 minutes to reach peak effectiveness..."

- Bad: "Bottom line: Both medications work equally well."
- Good: "Both medications work equally well."

- Bad: "Let's be real about side effects..."
- Good: "Side effects occur in 25-30% of users..."

### Voice Guidelines:
- **Second person** ("you") throughout
- **Active voice** always
- **Present tense** for immediacy
- **Contractions** (you're, it's, that's)
- **Short sentences** for impact
- **One idea per paragraph**

## Structure Template

### Title Formula:
- Problem-focused, not information-focused
- Use actual search language
- Include transformation hint

**Bad**: "Complete Guide to TRT Side Effects"
**Good**: "TRT Side Effects: What Actually Happens (And What You Can Control)"

### Opening (First 150 words):
1. **Hook** (2-3 sentences): Specific problem scenario
2. **Validation** (1-2 sentences): "You're not crazy/alone"
3. **Promise** (1-2 sentences): What this guide delivers
4. **Reality check** (1 sentence): Honest about complexity

**Template**:
```
[Specific problem scenario that reader is experiencing]

[Validation of their concern]

This guide [what it delivers—transformation, not information]. [Honest reality check about nuance/complexity].
```

### Body Structure:

#### Section 1: The Real Problem
- What's actually happening (beyond the surface symptom)
- Why conventional advice fails
- What's at stake emotionally

#### Section 2: What Actually Works

- Comparison table with real pros/cons
- Specific recommendations for different situations

#### Section 3: The Timeline

- Common setbacks and how to handle them
- Hidden costs (financial, emotional, lifestyle)
- Long-term reality check

#### Section 5: Your Next Step
- Clear decision tree
- Specific action based on their situation
- How to measure success

### Closing:
- Acknowledge the emotional weight
- Reiterate transformation
- Clear single next action

## Content Rules

### One Piece of Content = One Job

Each post has ONE transformation goal:

- **Comparison posts**: Help reader choose between 2 options
- **Timeline posts**: Set realistic expectations for a journey
- **Evidence posts**: Give confidence to try something new
- **Side effects posts**: Manage fear about starting treatment
- **Cost posts**: Make financial decision easier

Don't try to do multiple jobs. If content sprawls, split it.

### Native > Polished

- Reddit language > Clinical speak
- Real quotes > Paraphrased "people say"
- Specific numbers > Ranges ("8 weeks" not "6-12 weeks")
- Honest limitations > Overpromising
- Rough edges > Sterile perfection

### The "So What?" Test

After every claim, ask "So what?"

**Claim**: "Finasteride blocks DHT"
**So what?**: "Less DHT means less follicle miniaturization"
**So what?**: "Your hair stops thinning"
**So what?**: "You can style your hair without worrying about your crown showing"
**So what?**: "You stop avoiding photos and mirrors"

Keep asking until you hit the emotional outcome.

### Numbers Must Tell Stories

**Bad**: "73% of men respond to treatment"
**Good**: "3 out of 4 guys see results. If you're the 4th guy, you'll know by month 4—here's what to do next."

**Bad**: "Average weight loss is 15-20 lbs"
**Good**: "Most guys lose about 18 pounds in 6 months. That's one belt notch every 5 weeks."

## Category-Specific Guidelines

### Sexual Health (ED, PE)
- **Emotion**: Shame, anxiety, relationship fear
- **Language**: Direct but not graphic
- **Focus**: Confidence recovery, not just function
- **Timeline**: First success → consistent confidence
- **Key insight**: It's not about perfect performance

### Hair Health
- **Emotion**: Vanity shame, aging fear, decision paralysis
- **Language**: Acknowledge the stigma directly
- **Focus**: Peace of mind, not perfection
- **Timeline**: Month-by-month with photo comparisons
- **Key insight**: Results are slow and subtle

### Testosterone
- **Emotion**: Desperation, confusion, TRT fear
- **Language**: Cut through bro-science and medical gatekeeping
- **Focus**: Quality of life improvement

- **Key insight**: It's not a magic bullet

### Weight Loss (GLP-1s)
- **Emotion**: Hope fatigue, medication shame, cost anxiety
- **Language**: Acknowledge diet culture trauma

### Mental Health
- **Emotion**: Therapy stigma, skepticism, cost frustration

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, every post must pass:

### Voice Check:

- [ ] No passive voice in main content
- [ ] Contractions throughout

### Transformation Check:
- [ ] Opens with specific problem scenario
- [ ] Clear transformation promise in first 150 words
- [ ] Ends with single clear next action
- [ ] Addresses emotional outcome, not just functional fix

### Structure Check:
- [ ] One job per post (not trying to do everything)
- [ ] Decision framework is clear (not "it depends")
- [ ] Timeline with specific expectations
- [ ] "What nobody tells you" section exists
- [ ] Honest about setbacks

- [ ] Does it sound like you're explaining at a bar?
- [ ] Are you addressing fears, not just questions?
- [ ] Is the transformation specific and believable?

## Examples: Before vs. After

### Before (AI-Optimized):
> "Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is a treatment option for men with clinically low testosterone levels. Common side effects include acne (25-30% of users), testicular atrophy (65-70% of users), and mood changes (15-25% of users). It is important to note that individual experiences may vary. Consult your healthcare provider to discuss whether TRT is appropriate for your situation."

### After (Human-Centered):
> "You're reading about TRT side effects at 2 AM, which means you're probably terrified. Let's cut through the BS: Yes, most guys get some side effects. No, they're not all deal-breakers. Here's what actually happens—and what you can control.
>
> The weird part? The most common side effect (your balls shrinking) is also the easiest to prevent. But the side effect everyone asks about (heart problems) is the one doctors actually worry about. Let's break down what matters."

### Before (AI-Optimized):
> "Finasteride and minoxidil are two FDA-approved treatments for male pattern baldness. Finasteride works by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT. Minoxidil's mechanism is not fully understood but appears to prolong the anagen phase. Studies show that 65-85% of users maintain or improve hair density."

### After (Human-Centered):
> "You've been staring at your crown in every bathroom mirror. Your shower drain is a horror show. You're 28 and already thinking about buzzing it all off.
>
> Here's the deal: Finasteride stops the hair loss. Minoxidil regrows some of what you lost. You need both, they do different jobs, and yes, it's worth the hassle—but only if you start now. Every month you wait is hair you won't get back."

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Marketing Red Flags:
- Making it about our brands/products
- Hiding behind "consult your doctor" for everything
- Overpromising results
- Downplaying side effects or costs

### AI Red Flags:
- **Conversational filler phrases**: "Actually", "Real talk", "Here's what", "Let's be honest", "Bottom line:", "Reality check", "The truth is", "To be honest", "Just to be clear"
- **Trying-to-convince language**: Overuse of "really", persuasive "actually", hedging with conversational markers
- Bullet list walls
- "It's important to note..." phrases
- Balanced to the point of uselessness
- No clear recommendation or decision path
- Academic voice
- Over-explaining simple points
- Using section headers like "What Actually Happens" or "The Real Answer"

### Medical Red Flags:
- Giving specific medical advice beyond general education
- Contradicting standard medical guidelines
- Encouraging unsafe practices
- Overstating risks or benefits

## The Reddit Test

Before publishing, read your content aloud and ask:

1. **Would this get upvoted on Reddit?**
   - Or would someone comment "nice try, ChatGPT"?

2. **Does it answer the question behind the question?**
   - They ask "what are side effects?" They mean "should I be scared?"

3. **Would you text this to a friend?**
   - Or does it sound like you copy-pasted from WebMD?

4. **Does it help someone make a decision?**
   - Or just give them more information to be confused about?

If you fail any of these tests, rewrite.

## Final Notes

- **Be specific**: "8 weeks" beats "6-12 weeks"
- **Be honest**: Acknowledge what doesn't work
- **Be human**: Write like you're explaining to a friend
- **Be useful**: Every section should move toward a decision
- **Be real**: Use actual forum language and concerns

**Remember**: We're not writing for Google (though it'll rank). We're writing for the guy who's scared, confused, and looking for someone to cut through the BS and tell him what happens.

That's our job. Do it well.
