## Risk Analysis

### Potential Challenges

1. **Affiliate Program Availability**

   - Backup: Direct partnerships, CPA network exploration

2. **Medical Compliance**

   - Focus: Legitimate telehealth platforms only

3. **Competition**
   - Risk: Established health sites (Healthline, WebMD) dominate some keywords
   - Mitigation: Focus on comparison/review angle, telehealth-specific content
   - Advantage: Our niche is men's health + telehealth comparison

4. **Regulatory Changes**
   - Risk: Telehealth prescribing regulations vary by state

   - Note: Already documented state requirements in guides

### Opportunities

1. **First-Mover in Comparison Space**
   - Few comprehensive comparison sites cover sleep + herpes for men
   - Can establish authority early

2. **Cross-Sell Potential**
   - Users searching for one treatment often need others
   - Internal linking opportunities between categories
